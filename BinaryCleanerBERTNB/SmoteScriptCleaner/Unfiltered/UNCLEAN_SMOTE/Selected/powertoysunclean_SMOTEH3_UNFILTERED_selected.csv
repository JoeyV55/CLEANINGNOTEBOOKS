specific plugins also i believe @alekhyareddy28 is doing work to change up the logic for scoring the results which should also alleviate the noise issue from window walker || for signal words issue https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/issues/1915 || it is a p3 against v1 || looked through the intermittent issue with @alekhyareddy28  and apparently this is happening at launcher level since logging the results at the plugin interfaces shows ww returning the right results doing some clean up and then merging this ||

debug||pluginmanagerqueryforplugin |queryt|cost for windows indexer plugin <188ms>totally agree about the signal words however i think it should be a common approach at the launcher level to filter to specific plugins also i believe @alekhyareddy28 is doing work to change up the logic for scoring the results which should also alleviate the noise issue from window walker || for signal words issue https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/issues/1915 || it is a p3 against v1 || looked through the intermittent issue with @alekhyareddy28  and apparently this is happening at launcher level since logging the results at the plugin interfaces shows ww returning the right results doing some clean up and then merging this ||

where do they come from?for net core projects there are a couple issues with just building it normally since net core is designed to be portable net core projects will have a `<projectname>depsjson` file which has a list of all the dlls it is linked to and whenever the exe is launched the program first validates that all these dlls are present if you look at the json file it also links x86 arm and debug versions of all the dlls and we would want to avoid this requirement with the msi (even if they arent actually used on the user-end) (this was what had happened in this pr #2302  where debug dlls were initially added even though they wouldnt actually be used they were required in the output folder) the other issue is that by default for third-party nuget packages the dlls are not generated in the output folder and instead the local nuget package on the dev machine is referenced (this was an issue in case of launcher since it has 3rd part dependencies from wox but not an issue for settings)the solution to this is to use the publish option on vs to do it manually you can right click the project in vs -> publish and then set the configuration as a publish profile (this also has the option to do a `self-contained` publish to include net core dlls which is what was being done in #2637 ) by publishing you can select a runtime identifier (say win-x64) and that makes sure only x64 dlls are required **and** debug dlls are not required either it also ensures that the third party nuget package dlls are generated in the output dirthe same issues would probably apply if fz was migrated to net corein the changes currently in master for both settings and launcher we were doing a publish step as a post build event using msbuild however this seems to work perfectly for launcher only if you start from a clean build and it doesnt seem to work as expected on the build farm (possibly due to inconsistency between msbuild and vs) all the dlls get generated on the build farm and we get an msi but this issue happens #2758  publishing using a publish vs task from the pipeline rather than msbuild command might be better option but im not sure what portion of the cdpx pipeline can be modified by us since im not familiar with thatwith the changes in this pr (since the post build publish is removed) to generate an msi you would have to build solution then right click the settingsuirunner project and publish with the configuration like this![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/32061677/81318838-b01b2900-9043-11ea-9e0b-5bfc1bdd934dpng)and similar the powerlauncher project with a config like this![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/32061677/81318885-c75a1680-9043-11ea-8ccc-e5724b040e79png) || @crutkas looking back at the amount of context i had to provide for the net core project building i think we should reach out to the net core team and find out the best way to build/publish the project to get all the required dlls - 1 locally and 2 on the build farm || perhaps we could publish as an msi installer pre-build task instaed?

these are the things that we need to check after fixing:- #3469 - was reported earlier when users used kbm shortcut remaps to open pt run and that issue exists with this as well since we moved to ll hooks- we need to validate that the default alt+space hotkey override does not take place on os version less than 19h1 because powerlauncher should not be working in that case || > - we need to validate that the default alt+space hotkey override does not take place on os version less than 19h1 because powerlauncher should not be working in that casein reality now that we removed islands it should work much lower the issue then becomes the dual settings work which it pretty costly from a resource stance  ||

-->## summary of the pull requestadded a workaround for remaps to num lock key the issue occurred because the num lock key state is set before the key down message is intercepted by low level hooks so even if it is suppressed the num lock key state will still change to work around this whenever a numlock key down message is to be suppressed we additionally send numlock key up key down to make sure that the final state of num lock is unchanged**explanation:** numlock was turned off and user remapped num lock to a when user presses numlock internally it gets set to on key up is passed to release the key and next key down sets the state to off both of these events are suppressed so that they not get sent to any other hooks or the os then when the user releases the num lock key it gets set back to released state<!-- please review the items on the pr checklist before submitting-->## pr checklist* [x] applies to #3277 * [x] cla signed if not go over [here](https://claopensourcemicrosoftcom/microsoft/powertoys) and sign the cla<!-- provide a more detailed description of the pr other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->## detailed description of the pull request / additional comments- since there are multiple places where a num lock key event can be suppressed (either in the type key/shortcut ui or if num lock is remapped) the logic for this workaround was added in the main hookproc method just before sending the "return 1" to suppress this was easier since that is the final line of code where all the hook suppressions enter irrespective of the cause of the key suppression- to ensure that the workaround num lock events are always suppressed an additional flag was added which is set in the dwextrainfo param when using sendinput in the hook logic whenever an event is seen with this flag it will be suppressed without performing any remap logic<!-- describe how you validated the behavior add automated tests wherever possible but list manual validation steps taken as well -->## validation steps performedtested remapping from/to numlock and that numlock works fine if not remapped also tested pressing numlock while on typekey/shortcut interface (should not affect num lock state) > when i remap numpad2 -> numlock then when i press numpad2 it still does its original function instead of toggling the num lock keythat happens since we use virtual key codes and not scan codes when num lock is turned on the numpad keys are sent as numpad 1/2etc when num lock is off these keys are just detected as their alternate function (home end etc) and are indistinguishable from the normal home keys in your example when num lock is on the remap will work one time but then num lock is off so the "numpad 2" key no longer existsill create a separate issue to track that to see if we can get a workaround for that since its out of scope of this pr since this pr only fixes remappings from num lock to another

press numlock again to get the number 8 to show up pls let me know if im missing somethingi think what happens in this case is that when the numpad 2 key is pressed (in step 6) the key down message gets changed to num lock key down but now because num lock is on the key up message would be down arrow rather that numpad 2 which is why pressing numlock the first time it ignores the key down press because the system things numlock is already being pressed down so it needs to be pressed twice if we have logic to say that the down arrow event and the numpad 2 event are same (which may involve scan code or some other workaround) then that would be resolved but this is again unrelated to this pr since it doesnt change any logic for remapping to numlock || created #4116 to track the numpad

favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place: #xxx<!-- provide a more detailed description of the pr other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->## detailed description of the pull request / additional commentsthe changes made in this pr are as follows -* the `win32storage` list has been modified to use a class called `win32programrepository` which implements `listrespository` and `iprogramrepository` just like in packaged applications with this change all the items are stored in a concurrent dictionary and adding deleting indexing all programs has become easier as concurrent dictionary is thread safe we do not need locks while setting/deleting items* when a win32 application is added there can be a chance of duplicates to avoid this situation the `gethashcode()` function of win32 has been overridden so that the custom win32 gethashcode() function is used this ensures that no duplicates are present in the list even when we actively add or delete apps* the `win32programrepository` and `win32programrepositoryhelper` classes have been added to watch certain locations and trigger `created` `deleted` or `renamed` events whenever such an operation is performed on a file to prevent these events from being triggered for non app type files we add `filters` these filters raise events only for those particular type of applications [filters](https://docsmicrosoftcom/en-us/dotnet/api/systemiofilesystemwatcherfilters?viewnetcore-31)* the `filesystemwatchers` filter out exe lnk appred-ms and url type files and call the `getappfrompath(path)` function which has been added to the win32 class this function returns the corresponding win32 item which can be added to the list * wrappers and interfaces have been added to `filesystemwatcher` `systemiofile` and `fileversioninfo` classes so that they can be mocked and tested* `shelllinkhelper` is implementing the interface `ishelllinkhelper` so that the win32 shortcut programs (lnk) can be tested* for shortcut apps `getappfrompath` doesnt give us the expected fullpath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the fullpath is set using the shelllinkhelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the **exe fullpath** from the lnkfile* for `deleted` apps since we have no more information to go on we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkresolved path* for `renamed` apps we have more information about the existing app so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list this is done so that we have an app which has the same name exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same<!-- describe how you validated the behavior add automated tests wherever possible but list manual validation steps taken as well -->## validation steps performed* manually validated it* added tests -1  to ensure that the we will not be introducing duplicates2 for each event {created renamed deleted} and app type {exe lnk appred-ms url} a test has been added to validate that the filesystemwatcher work as expected* all the other program plugin tests pass as well![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/28739210/87326150-368e3400-c4e7-11ea-84d5-3f7f14ad7be2png) @bao-qian and @jjw24 this pr may be

results for example :>    a type in `notion` in the search box>    b uninstall `notionexe`>    c  press hotkey to bring up the launcher `notion` is still present in the resultsthis is not related to this pr that is how pt run is the results are obtained once for each query i dont think this is related to this pr the user has to change the query for the results to update this would be the same situation with even uwp applications/anything else as well jsonrpc is used to communicate with each plugin for each query and once the results are obtained they are displayed> 2 if i abruptly close powerlauncher (say by closing debugging session directly) the cache for the uninstalled program is still present on the next launch we should verify cache validity on startupyea i think it is a good suggestion apps which are deleted when pt run is not running also show up because of the cache issue i think it is a generic issue and i shall create it an issue so that we can work on it> 3 if i rename an internet application it keeps all the previous version as welli tested this out to ensure that this would not happen can you please share information about the app (ie lnkresolvedpath fullpath exename) so that i can repro it and try to debug > 4 i added a program using epic games which installed a `url` shortcut on desktop but this change is not detectedi tested it out with steam games and it worked as expected i shall try out epic games as wellregarding 12 i think they are not a scope of this pr regarding 3 and 4 i shall look into why thats happening and try to fix it || @somil55 i tried installing the same game on the desktop while pt run was executing in the background and it works as expected would be great if you could help me figure out those two scenarios because im not able to repro them thanks!![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/28739210/87615003-77906f00-c6c6-11ea-88c9-94f497cb85ecpng) || regarding 1 we actually do that in certain cases for example when theme is changed query is refreshed to update the theme-specific icon this was done in #4499 but i agree that 1 2 can be done as part of separate pr the app in 3 is hangouts chrome extension with the following info ```lnkresolvepath : c:\\users\\divyan\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start menu\\programs\\chrome apps\\google hangouts dlnkfullpath : c:\\program files (x86)\\google\\chrome\\application\\chrome_proxyexeexecutablename : chrome~1exe```i am able to repro this issue each time i rename this file please tell me if you need any more information  || i resolved all the commentsa few things to point out -1 i noticed that we were previously not disposing all the plugins properly we had the code for disposing events in the plugin manager but we had `var disposableplugin  plugin as idisposable` instead of `var disposableplugin  pluginplugin as idisposable` and hence the dispose functions werent being called i fixed that and ensured that all the plugins are being properly disposed of and even the file system watchers are being properly disposed2 regarding the renaming of shortcut apps i was previously just removing the extension to get the name of the app from the `oldname` rename event handler args however the `name` parameter contains the path as well with respect to the directory that we are watching i used `pathgetfilenamewithoutextension(path)` and that fixes the issue3 regarding the url apps showing up sometimes it was because the installation of the game was not yet complete and it was still being written to hence when we tried to call the function `readalllines` it would throw an ioexception now i have added a retry block after a set amount of time this would not halt anything because it is on the file system watcher event handler thread || @somil55 i tried to fix it by adding some retry attempts i have created an issue to look into it #5072 can this pr be merged in as it is a huge pr and i need to be resolving merge conflicts? i shall look into that issue separately as a part of this iteration ||

general settingsjson file on being accessed by settings was throwing a file in use ioexception because it was being used by another process the way settings and runner worked before this pr is as follows: the settings on start-up checks if the general settingsjson file exists and reads from it if not it creates a new one the runner on the other hand during start-up does not save to the file (`apply_general_settings` is passed with a false save argument) there is no contention during this parthowever the issue occurs when settings tries to open the general settingsjson file everytime it needs information in any viewmodel or converter when any change is made in the settings that information is communicated to the runner and it is the runners responsibility to write to the settingsjson file however since we have one process continuously trying to read from a file and the other writing to the same file there is contentionto fix this issue the following changes have been made -* rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodels `generalsettingsconfig` a public static variable* the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up```public shellpage()        {            initializecomponent()            datacontext  viewmodel            shellhandler  this            viewmodelinitialize(shellframe navigationview keyboardaccelerators)            shellframenavigate(typeof(generalpage))        }```* therefore the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in its constructor the generalviewmodel tries to open the settingsjson file and loads the information from it if it exists if not it creates a new settingsjson file hence this variable is always initialized when settings is running this is also the only time the settingsjson file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention) from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the `generalsettingsconfig` in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol)## validation

variable* the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up```public shellpage()        {            initializecomponent()            datacontext  viewmodel            shellhandler  this            viewmodelinitialize(shellframe navigationview keyboardaccelerators)            shellframenavigate(typeof(generalpage))        }```* therefore the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in its constructor the generalviewmodel tries to open the settingsjson file and loads the information from it if it exists if not it creates a new settingsjson file hence this variable is always initialized when settings is running this is also the only time the settingsjson file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention) from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the `generalsettingsconfig` in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol)## validation steps performed_how does someone test & validate?_* all tests pass (the format had to be changed for initializing generalsettings based on the code changes)* manually validated in release as well as in debug mode that the crash no longer occurs* also validated that the converters work as expected by changing the theme![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/28739210/93115579-e5c6c300-f670-11ea-85e1-c37e30464a09png) @alekhya  is it possible to abstract the data for the generalsettingsviewmodel that is shared across view models into an implementation of an interface that can be dependency injected instead of statically referenced    i think this would improve the code in the following ways 1) it facilitates unit testing the various view models that need to react to a particular state of the general settings 2) [philosophical point] a view model is responsible for providing data to a particular view moving to an interface avoids coupling the other viewmodels to the existence of a particular viewmodel and can encapsulate lazy loading of the information which avoids assumptions of the sequence that other view models get loaded in  || @alekhyareddy28 what will happen if for some reason writing `settingsjson` fails in runner ? the settings ui would display updated values even

to the settings each view model shouldnt need to synchronize and ensure resiliency wrt to serialization/deserialization of the the data individually i think that issue could be treated separately though@ryanbodrug-microsoft i agree that centralizing settings would tackle these issue and it can be handled separately thanks for your clarification || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the changes as suggestednow we have a wrapper singleton class namely `generalsettingscache` which has a property `commonsettingsconfig` these configurations are shared across all the viewmodels ive not touched settingsutilscs and the file handing/ipc i was thinking if we need to make any changes to unify that we can do so after we get your refactoring/testing pr invalidated the following:* runner and all powertoys respond correctly to changes in settings* settings reads only once (on start-up) from the settingsjson file throughout its lifetime it continues to get information from the `generalsettingscache`* validated that the modelconverter also works as expected and that there is only one instance of the `commonsettingsconfig` shared across all the viewmodels* all tests pass-![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/28739210/93393297-210af280-f827-11ea-960b-3eeb1582e316png) || @ryanbodrug-microsoft ive made the suggested changes there is now a generic singleton class `settingsrepository` which encapsulates the disk accessesso any viewmodel can get the settings information using `settingsrepository<generalsettings>instancesettingsconfig` `settingsrepository<shortcutguidesettings>instancesettingsconfig`right now fz shortcut guide and power preview use this interface along with generalsettings ive validated the a change in the settings ui in each of these reflects in the actual powertoy (other than preview handlers which seem to be on all the time)as suggested ive added a lock during initialization of `settingsrepository` and also added tests for the same to ensure that multiple instances are not created when accessed by multiple threadsi shall look into migrating the other pt settings to this repository once i get a better understanding of the way in which each of them accesses the disk/passes the information to runneri hvnt moved the ipc delegates to settingsutils from the view models yet shall do that separately as this pr is getting quite big thanks for patiently reviewing this pr 😄  || also to add the getfile function should ideally not be needed in the long run previously getsettings was just reading from a file and did not have a check to see if the file existed or notsince getsettings has been modified to create the file if it does not exist getfile does what getsettings previously used to this is because in two cases the defaultjson file of kbm and settingsjson of pt run these two files are assumed to be created by runner (if they dont exist) and not settings hence the `getfile()` function was added || pulled the changes for master which modified the settings testsmade the following changes :* shortcutguide fz powerpreview dont need settingsutils to be passed as it is encapsulated within the settings repositorys settigns config object hence that has been removed* the tests have been refactored so that they work when settings utils is passed to the setting repository generic interface previously the stub of getsettings was a generic with no type constraints hence it could be easily mocked as `<itisanytype>` however since the getsettings function must now implement the `isettingsconfig` interface the stub has been modified accordingly there is no functionality in moq to specify a generic with a type constraint other than using a custom matcher even if we go down this route the class definitions have to be modified to implement `itypematcher` and they must still be invoked individually by specifying the class as `getsettings<generalsettings>`* validated that all refactored tests pass![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/28739210/93908033-f7cce500-fcb2-11ea-9114-d050207feb32png)* validated that settings and all powertoys work as expected with and without previous settings config files ||

(like someone may delete a drop down by selecting none so another drop downs list may have to be refreshed which could mess up an existing selection) thats why when this was initially made we went the route of showing warnings when a user selects a & b together for example rather than making the drop down show only modifiers/only action keys it sounds like it could be a lot of changes> along with that i noticed that it would be good to have `boxlist` of `comboboxitem`s so we can attach key code as value in that way we can throw away indexes logic so we do not have to rely on the exact order in the two arrays(key codes and key code names) what do you think?> it will help if we want to keep different amount of keys in different orders for dropdowns> should we implement it in this pull request or create separate issue?this sounds good but i think its better to create a separate issue for this to keep the scope of this pr smaller i think while the change to comboboxitems is made it could also be possible to do the "not show disable in the drop down" and similar for modifier/action keys like it could be something like if there is only 1 drop down you can choose any key and if there are more the non-last dropdowns will have only modifier keys and the last one again allows you to choose any (except disable since that is a separate case) since a lot more features have been added in this code space recently (like key to shortcut/shortcut to key disable being added now etc) i think there are some places for cleaning up the ui code like this || > * one ui case where it is possible to select modifier+disable (ive mentioned in a separate comment the missing code)> * there is one more place in the shortcutcontrol file where getkeycodelist has to be replaced with the new version for the first call it should have `renderdisabled` as false and for second it should be trueit is two more reasons to implement https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/issues/6913 || does this implement @jmahlerss pr from https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/pull/6236 or the two are related but independent?  || it was built on top of it adding tests and implementing the shortcut disable feature as well along with some tweaks ||

[here](https://claopensourcemicrosoftcom/microsoft/powertoys) and sign the cla* [x] tests added/passed## info on pull request_what does this include?_module changes:- the existing code for enabling/disabling involves removing/adding the registry key which is added during installation but it was set for hkcu reg instead of hklm (in the installer it was changed to hklm in a later release) because of this enabling/disabling could add/remove some unused registry entries this has been changed to hklm to avoid any errors in the future if the code is uncommented- for thumbnail providers the registry modification steps were incorrect so they have been changed accordingly to read/write `hkcr/fileextension/{e357fccd-a995-4576-b01f-234630154e96}` with value as the clsid of the provider- to allow the `fileexplorerpreviewsettings` code to be more usable for future modules `fileexplorerpreviewsettings` was made into an interface with most methods implemented except the registry related methods `previewhandlersettings` and `thumbnailprovidersettings` classes were added which implemented the above interfaces this separation was made since the registry paths and logic differed between the two with this change the two variables for storing the preview handlers and thumbnail providers in `powerpreview` were combined- removed unnecessary arguments in registry wrapper- a `checkregistrystate` method was added to the interface which is used to check if the registry key (for enabling/disabling that module) is already present with the correct values or not- `updatestate` method in the interface was modified such that it takes elevation state as argument after updating the toggle state and checking if the file explorer powertoy is enabled it checks if the registry state already matches the new state if it doesnt it makes the necessary update if pt is elevated or returns a failure if it is not elevated- in `set_config` in `powerpreview` when a setting changes updatestate is called on all the modules and if any of them return a failure a warning message is shown to the user indicating the user would have to restart pt as admin for settings to take effect (this code path would generally not occur in new settings it could occur in old settings though)- in `powerpreview` a wrapper was added which first checks if the registry state of all the modules matches the toggle state and if it doesnt it performs a method if elevation or shows the warning if not elevated- the wrapper is used in enable() so that modules which are enabled as per the toggle setting should be enabled in registry since enable gets called when pt is started if there is a mismatch between the settings if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules- an elevation only check wrapper is also used in disable() so that modules get disabled in registry only if elevated since disable gets called when pt is started if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules- regarding the above 2 points the enable/disable setting is not exposed in new settings but it is in old settings this could cause issues if a user upgrades from old to new settings via windows update and previously disabled file explorer as they can never re-enable itui changes:- the settings format for file explorer was invalid (on c# side) and would get ignored by runner as it had `properties` instead of `properties` that has been fixed- since the registry can be modified only if pt is run as admin additional text has been added to warn the user that the settings can be modified only if run as admin this is visible only if pt is unelevated- when pt is unelevated the toggles and text for these settings are disabled- an additional textblock has been added for thumbnail provider toggles to indicate a reboot might be required for changes to take effect- for checking elevation the  viewmodel has been modified to include the general settings as well (as done in some other settings modules) the iselevated value of the general settings config is used tests have been refactored accordingly to include the extra argument## tests- updated existing powerpreview setregistryvalue tests to check registryvalue as well- split updatestate tests to include elevation status and previewhandler vs thumbnailprovider differences- split enable/disable tests for previewhandler and thumbnailprovider to check correct registry details## feedback required- text on the warning dialogs and the settings page- unused "enable" setting for file explorer the "enable" value for file explorer in the general settings file was used in old settings as there was an external toggle and separate toggles for each handler but there is no toggle in new settings so there is no way to modify that value if a user was using old settings (ie old windows version) and had file explorer disabled when they move the new settings by windows update the setting will still be disabled but it cannot be changed from pt settings and the user has to manually modify the json should we deprecate that or add another toggle which results in all the handlers getting disabled? (the equivalent of the enable toggles for a powertoy as a whole)- modifying registry when running pt from vs (and pt isnt installed) could lead to bad registry this could affect devs## validation steps performed_how does someone test & validate?_- build and install msi- before running pt validate that md/svg preview handlers are working and svg thumbnails are working- check your general settings json file and file explorer settings file based on the values you should see one of the scenarios (similarly when powertoys isnt running you can modify the file to one of the scenarios below to check if the expected behavior occurs) run powertoys elevated/unelevated and check the corresponding row the expected behavior below assumes that all 3 modules are enabled in the registry (as would occur in a fresh install) if file explorer is enabled in general settings for any other registry state basically if the json and registry states dont match in case of unelevated powertoys it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will make the changes as per json if file explorer is not enabled all of them will always be disabled | file explorer in general settings | file explorer settings (svg-ph svg-tp md-ph) | elevation | behavior                                                  ||-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|| enabled                           | all enabled                                    | false     | no warning and all 3 work                                 || enabled                           | all enabled                                    | true      | no warning and all 3 work                                 || disabled                          | any combination                                | false     | warning and all 3 work                                    || disabled                          | any combination                                | true      | no warning and all 3 disabled                             || enabled                           | at least one disabled                          | false     | warning and all 3 work                                    || enabled                           | at least one disabled                          | true      | no warning and only the ones which are enabled will work |     im ok with disabling the current options but it would be better to add something to the page since it looks like there was a rendering problemcan we remove only the toggles and leave some text to list the current available extensions?

stackpanel as it is hard to accomplish with the grid- i tried to make minimum changes to accomplish it- it seems like we can do a better job with ui part it is important to achieve encapsulation of components it feels unnatural when `keydropdowncontrol` functions have grid as a parameter but it is not a priority now as that part will be migrated to xaml## pr checklist* [x] applies to #2659* [x]

core contributors already if not checked im ready to accept this work might be rejected in favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place: #xxx## info on pull request_what does this include?_- layout was changed from grid to stackpanel- grid and stackpanel parameters were replaced to `rowindex` in some functions because it simplifies things- banded rows are accomplished manually that means if the number of rows changes the background of rows should be updated- arrow column width is hardcoded now before it was calculated as table width minus width of other columns other columns and table widths were hardcoded so it does not make the difference_how does someone test & validate?_- test all functionality of remap keys and remap shortcuts windows- test the same

two aspects of the same problem other than this kbm works  || @ivan100sic good catch! the problem was that callbacks capture row id as integer so after deleting a row indexes shifts and it crashes

[x] temperature names are prefixed with degree (eg degreecelsius/degreefahrenheit) make sure words without the prefix (eg celsius) suffices- [x] temperature shorthand needs a degree symbol to work correctly make sure it doesnt (eg 10 f in c should work)- [x]  sometimes stuff like 15" in cm returns scientific power to 10th notation (eg 43179999999999994e+17) this should probably just round (eg to 4318)- [x] culture dependent input should work (use of  or )- [ ] ~~support multiple length input such as 1 foot 5 inch in cm (?)~~- [x] support copy to clipboard translations- [x] change to use the keywords to and in (if its even possible to use multiple keywords find out)## quality checklist- [x] **linked issue:** as stated i didnt open an issue before doing work (i know very naughty) but

support for `` is nothing we must have it was only a question if we could improve something there so lets not waste time on this- for the warning on unsupported input please see my comment above i suggested a text there (btw calculator plugin shows a warning on incorrect input) i think warning on input that cant be converted is good enough- ~can you please post a list of supported unit types in pr description~ (if possible we should support at least the same as windows calculator)- any reason why you use an old version of nunit package? || #### misspellings found please review:* angularsen*

questions about:> * the first thing i saw is that the result are included in global results i think we should change the default behavior herei edited the `pluginjson` and set the `"isglobal"` to `false`  i hope thats what you meant? if not let me know what exactly needed to be changed i couldnt find it in the docs> for the warning on unsupported input please see my comment above i suggested a text there (btw calculator plugin shows a warning on incorrect input) i think warning on input that cant be converted is good enoughi checked the `calculator` plugin but couldnt find code that generated the warning i tried to input invalid strings to see if i could generate it (such as `sqrt(-9)`) but couldnt get the warning to show do you have input and/or a reference to the line of code so i can use it as an reference?i think these are the only things missing if theres anything else let me know :)oh i got the requirement of a space between a number and unit removed! `1m to cm` works nowi also added in every unit that the windows calculator currently supports even got the `1 kb to kb` working correctly (which google apparently doesnt do)cheers! 😄  || @thiefzero > > * the first

needs to not interfere with symbols that have already another meaning in windows and that can prevent to use them in better scenariossince users can change them we need to provide something that is good enough and that wont cause conflicts or prevent future features in other pluginsim actually going to suggest that for non-core plugins we should not use single key activation phrase as a general rule || > > > @thiefzero do you have any thoughts for a good cmd line here? what feels natural? with doubles for something like this i like it when it is the same keystroke> > `%%` or just `%`?thanks for your consideration and actively involving me in the discussion i was approaching it hands-off because im not super familiar with the use action keywordsmy thoughts on this: im not sure why its necessary to have one in this case as you would need to put something in to convert anyway so having to use an action keyword first only adds another requirement i can see the benefit of having action keywords for something like `!` to list all services but not for plugins that require input (`` for `calculator` similarly seems redundant to me)(if im missing something feel free to teach me!)if we have to choose a keyword for the `unitconverter` i think theres merit in having the easy-to-use symbols reserved for microsoft (core) plugins as opposed to using them for community (non-core) ones so id say that `->` or `>` or `` would be fine otherwise i like `%` symbolically the best - it feels most like 2 values being converted maybe `%%` as its non-core || @enricogior im fine with doubles for non-core  why i suggest the same is doing -> requires much more movement and a shift between for at least a en-us keyboardlets go with %% for now and see what people think || # @check-spelling-bot

since crutkass commit now that `%%` is the activation phrase we can turn it off by default and it should work im not sure what the team wants here personally i think having it global by default is better as im guessing its a very basic and useful functionality for most userslastly it still has only the very basic rounding function (not the advanced one you suggested) this would be the last

just want to let you know a few things since we are moving away from using lowercase for modules names so for both folders under `src/modules` and for vs projects please use camelcase we are also making changes to the module interface project naming convention vs the actual module project - standalone exe should be named **powertoysespressoexe** - for the vs projects naming convention:     - the folder/project that implement the module interface should be named **espressomoduleinterface**     - the folder/project that implement the module should be name **espresso** when the module has just one project beside the module interface     - if the module has multiple sub projects choose a name accordingly: eg **espressoservice** **espressolibrary** etc || thanks @enricogior - will be

13363,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,[pt run] improvements on environmenthelper and deletion of old env vars ## summary of the pull request**what is this about:**while adding exception handling to `environmenthelper` (other pr) i detected that removed machine and user environment variables are not deleted when updating the process environment**what is include in the pr:** - improving the code- fix: path variable was merged incorrectly- added: feature to delete variables that doesnt exist anymore- handle variable name casing correctly![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/61519853/138588863-15a09fe8-4286-41b5-a5e5-df6504578e12png)**todo-list**- [x] fix bugs- [x] code optimization: var names like `uvar` and `mvar`- [x] case handling for variable names   - [x] test what happens in windows/cmd if `path` variable exists with different var name casing (path ! path) for user and machine   - [x] analyze windows behavior if we have a general variable that has different casing (name vs name vs name) on user and machine level   - [x] making dict and hashset case insensitive that machine key casing is used    - [x] add code to correct casing on case change- [x] error handling where we get or set env vars and duration cost logging- [x] add code to remove unchanged vars from dictionary- [x] add else statement to log skipped vars if listed as protected- [x] testing!!!!- [x] fix merge conflicts**how does someone test / validate:** i plan to test the code manually the following test are planned:- [x] protected vars list   - list gets generated: **success**   - list content is correct: **success**   - vars on the list cant be changed on update: **success**- [x] machine vars   - add new variable: **success**   - change value: **success**   -

this browser3 in the `extendeturiparser` we hafe a selection if it is http https or an other uri type if you add a new return value or property that decides if it is default browser or app handler
