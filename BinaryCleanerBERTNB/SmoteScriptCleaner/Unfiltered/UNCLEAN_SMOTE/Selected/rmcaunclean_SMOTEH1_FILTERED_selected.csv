contract gets created and sometimes it throws above kind of error. moreover  when we tried to create the contract based on same po after around 20 hours  it worked and above error was no more there for any new customer/contract. perhaps  cpms rmca cache got updated.   well  i think above kind of error is not expected at all  if we are creating the contract via bae. but because of missing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- the issue can be  by creating a new version of the refill nes specification and including "unit type" (as brl) for the "decimal" nes parameter "refillamount".      please be informed that this unit type (for measurement based parameters) was introduced way before in ft24-9 (if im not wrong) which came quite a few years before. the nes configuration that you have been importing is pretty old.   to add on to it  recently as part of ft23-147 (post 20.2)  cha introduced validations for nes parameters of datatype "measurement" and "datetime". due to this  cha validates the uom (unitofmeasurement) for a measurement based nes parameter.   for example: lets say the refillamountin is 50.25 usd but your nes specification expects brl as the measure  then we shouldnt allow the enrichment output (50.25 usd) to be saved in refillamountout (whose nes spec says measure should be brl) due to validation issue.   for a nes parameter to be classified as measurement  it should satisfy the following: decimal number (decimal) + unit type (measure) (eg.) 50.25 usd - measure was not validated until 20.2 which is why the enrichment was successful until 20.2 - this existed even before ft23-147 (or) integer number (long) + unit type (measure) (eg.) 50 usd - this combination is introduced in ft23-147   the configuration which you shared did not contain "measure" for the nes parameter of type "decimal"  hence it was coming as null leading to the nullpointerexception.   snippet from your configuration:      snippet of a proper configuration:    cha shouldnt do a null check here since null is not expected at all for a decimal based parameter. a decimal parameter should always have a unit type associated with it for cha to use it. cha doesnt support "decimal" only  (without measure) type. as you can see from the dynamicfunction output types  we only have measurement and not decimal. if cha performs a null check  then the purpose of validation will be defeated.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   software version:  [root@sot12-msvall1 admin]# swrepo list

HZ43719,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0, trouble summary there is currently a check in rmca which intends to exclude bundle-only product offerings from being included as top-level entries in recurrence priority lists  since these products cannot be used and prioritize without being part of a bundle. this check is  however  wrong as it does not evaluate the bundle_only characteristic value as it should.   . detailed trouble description the current check for the bundle_only flag merely checks for the presence of the characteristic with that purpose on the po  which will never be found  since the characteristic resides on the ps. this check needs to be updated so that the actual value chosen on the po is taken into account.   . workaround and recovery n/a - these entries should not cause any traffic impact  but are misleading for the user.

priceenrichmentvalidationrule exception is thrown during agreement spec publishing via ba portal.  the issue is that the validation rule (priceenrichmentvalidationrule) erroneously tries to use specs in draft when performing the validation in publish step. this leads to the spec not being found  hence the crash.  swrepo  [root@vmp-msvsuf1 vmp-gtm1]# swrepo list | grep "rmca" rmca

"contract contains" is that the rulecontract section in the xml rule (attached in original mail  and screenshot below) has a datadefinition for each characteristic that the rule will use. the rule is not allowed to use any other values than those listed in the rule contract.  . detailed trouble description   . workaround and recovery fix should be update the test data as well and it needs to be backported to ft29-23 fix level (please check with tony).
