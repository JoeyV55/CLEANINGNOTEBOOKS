|| the comment on the pr is for that please share your opinion or question there too :)thx for taking the time to take a look at it by the way :) || when you get some free time please take a look at https://githubcom/lpandzic/junit-bdd im trying to gather some feedback from junit guys but none were given thanks! || hey can you share the link on the mailing list so people can discuss there :)also i will post the link on twitteranyway from just looking at the readme page i find the api quite elegant || i will thanks for feedback! :) || hey guysdid you consider this:then(person times(2))ride(bike)then(person)ride(bike) || i find the original case more readable so i must say im against it is there any concrete case where it doesnt read well? || i agree with lovro i find the original idea more readable || for example: then(task)should()completed()then(mock)method() is more consistent with the original apii really like your idea though i think it reads very nicely || yes that could work with aliases like``` javashouldbe()validated()has()performed()has(times(2))performed()``` || > i really like your idea though i think it reads very nicelythanksthere is one more problematic case: timeout()maybe more aliases should be introduced? || hey guysi thought about this and im tempted to remove this new method from the api i really like how it looks but on the other hand i dont want mockito api to grow in tactical aliases that solve mini use cases there is a room for this kind of aliases but id rather mockito api to be simple and opinionated perhaps there should be a separate library called mockito-bdd? also its pretty easy to add such aliases to any codebase simpler api like """"then(task)completed()"""" would be ok for me because its truly an alias - it has exactly the same signature but the method name is different hence it does not complicate the api however it seems that you prefer more fluency - this could be different library that depends on mockito-core and has bunch of bdd aliaseslovro i really like your coding and id love to get more contributions from you! || btw thoughts? i can always be convinced :) || > lovro i really like your coding and id love to get more contributions from you!thanks!i must say that i still stand by my original pull request and its design> for example: then(task)should()completed()i think that only listener methods can be problematic (oncompletion) with current implementation normal methods usually dont go in past tense || but abandoning the should part and leaving only then wouldnt be bad for me either i just hope this gets released some time soon :) || i will release really soon i wanted to close down this api change actually before the release :)i totally respect your pov regarding should() methodoptions we have (ive conveniently removed options that dont work for me ):1 back out the feature from master possibly include more bdd aliases somewhere else2 change the feature to then(task)dostuff() if we do that we will reserve the then word/method and the original option wont be possible any more (even in a separate library)id say we do 1) but i will concede to your votes lovro/brice?thanks again for your input! || heyi thought about this and lets release it in the original shape eg as it is now in the codebase :)do you mind improving the impl a little bit?1 can you add info about this new feature from the mockito main class?2 it would be better if then was an interface and the implementing class not-public (protected or package-protected is fine)ill probably hide this feature from the codebase for the next release however once you get above items done submit pr well merge it and it should get _automatically_ released it will be nice test for the continuous deployment implementation :) || ah nevermind lets just have it in the coming release do you mind doing the 1-2 items in a different pr?

strange thing is that there never was onedid you maybe run with a different java version in the process? until java 7 non-generic arrays were also represented by instances of `genericarraytype` when returned from the generic reflection methods since java 7 generic arrays with a non-generic component type are properly resolved as `class` instancesnevertheless this needs a fix in mockito as i understand it i just sent a pull request || the test code is executed using oracle java 8 (18040-b25) on osxi updated mockito from 195 to 1100 in the process of updating from java7 to java8 || you are right the change came with java 8 fixed with my pull request || @raphw nice catch and thanks for the patch :)@scameronde thanks for reporting :) || by the way @raphw as you may be one of the only person around mockito that can give thorough feedback on the generic support class in mockito do you see how to improve it ? || well as i am currently dealing with generic types a lot i can only tell that it is quite complex to beginn with but i am deep in the matter these days i will look at the implementation some time and see if i can improve it for now it looks save apart from the fact that you were missing generic type arrays || yes it was developed on java 7 and missed that anyway thanks again || you got to love the open source community thank you a lot for the fast response and the

well:1 there is nothing guaranteeing that production code passes foo to subjectundertest it could likely pass a cousin class realfoo2 that implements serializable just fine (or not but the test doesnt help me with that) it needs to be tested but imho not against a mock foo especially when mockitos when()thenreturn() syntax adds non-existent serializable requirement to the mock object2 given the proxy pattern that foo doesnt _look like_ a serializable class isnt a guarantee that it cant be so by throwing this error mockito enforces stricter constraint than whats technically necessaryi agree that checking basic serializable requirement in mockito can catch some bugs if case 2 can be fixed its likely that case 1 would not have triggered so many false positivesbut with all our workarounds already added because of case 2 and the fair number of our tests triggering this error the amount of work to fix all of them before we can upgrade mockito looks dauntingso i guess my question is: **can we do away with mockcreationvalidatorvalidateserializable() or make it an opt-in?**sorry for the long message"";heres a real example the subject under test looks like this:```class subjectundertest implements serializable {  private final foofactory factory  subjectundertest(foofactory factory) {    thisfactory factory  }    foo foo  factorycreatefoo()  }```the testing framework actually tries to serialize subjectundertest so foofactory needs to be serializable toothe test using mockito looks like this:```foo foo  mock(fooclass)foofactory mockfactory  mock(foofactoryclass withsettings()serializable())when(mockfactorycreatefoo())thenreturn(foo)subjectundertest subject  new subjectundertest(mockfactory)```but when the framework serializes `subject` we get an exception because the line of `when(mockfactorycreatefoo())thenreturn(foo)` implicitly adds foo as part of `mockfactory` stateto work around the problem our tests had to make foo serializable too:```foo foo  mock(fooclass withsettings()serializable())```again production code doesnt need foo to be serializable and it may not have a default constructorthats status quonow with v11019 the above work-around breaks because foo doesnt implement serializable nor has a default constructorback to square one if i had the choice i would strongly discourage the code that mocks either foofactory or foo instead it should just be a plain old foofactory subclass that returns foo with java 8 the syntax would actually become more concise than the mockito syntax but i cant go back and fix so many teams code as it stands today this is the biggest issue blocking the upgradehopefully ive made a clear case || thanks for reportingim ok with removing the check or making it smarter it seems to be a legituse case brice?cheers!on fri jul 3 2015 at 2:50 pm ben yu notifications@githubcom wrote:> heres a real example the subject under test looks like this:> > class subjectundertest implements serializable {>   private final foofactory factory> >   subjectundertest(foofactory factory) {>     thisfactory factory>   }> >   >   foo foo  factorycreatefoo()>   > }> > the testing framework actually tries to serialize subjectundertest so> foofactory needs to be serializable too> > the test using mockito looks like this:> > foo foo  mock(fooclass)> foofactory mockfactory  mock(foofactoryclass withsettings()serializable())> when(mockfactorycreatefoo())thenreturn(foo)> subjectundertest subject  new subjectundertest(mockfactory)> > but when the framework serializes subject we get an exception because> the line of when(mockfactorycreatefoo())thenreturn(foo) implicitly adds> foo as part of mockfactory state> > to work around the problem our tests had to make foo serializable too:> > foo foo  mock(fooclass withsettings()serializable())> > > again production code doesnt need foo to be serializable and it may not> have a default constructor> > thats status quo> > now with v11019 the above work-around breaks because foo doesnt> implement serializable nor has a default constructor> > back to square one if i had the choice i would strongly discourage the> code that mocks either foofactory or foo instead it should just be a> plain old foofactory subclass that returns foo with java 8 the syntax> would actually become more concise than the mockito syntax> > but i cant go back and fix so many teams code as it stands today this> is the biggest issue blocking the upgrade> > hopefully ive made a clear case> > â€”> reply to this email directly or view it on github> https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/245#issuecomment-118431952## szczepan faberfounder mockitoorg core dev gradleorgtweets as @szczepiq blogs at blogmockitoorg || hi is this reasonable?

i wonder if that was a cleaner solution || > would adding an annotation to the junit plugin not be another altivertive? i wonder if that was a cleaner solutionintroducing a new annotation in mockitos official junit 5 support is of course technically possible -- thats what our proof-of-concept `mockitoextension` does today (ie we created an `@injectmock` annotation)but i dont think i would call that a _cleaner solution_ imho a single annotation from mockito would be the cleanest solution since it would result in the **element of least surprise** for users of mockitofwiw we have already hashed out the [exact same discussion for the spring framework](https://jiraspringio/browse/spr-14057) with regard to springs `@autowired` annotation previously it was not allowed to be declared on a constructor or method parameter but we changed this for spring 43 || ok considering that junit and mockito is such a common combination lets just make it as easy as possible || sounds good! ðŸ‘  || wow  a lot of work got done while i was out celebrating fathers day  from a users perspective this all looks perfect  how often do you get everything you ask for?  i guess i have one final  question which since this issue is closed is more academic - where should an official production ready mockitoextension for junit 5 be hosted?  mockitojunit is obviously part of the mockito project and the mokitoextension will always rely on both mockito and junit 5maintaining the status quo would be fine but it might also make sense to create a junit5-extensions project for """"common combinations"""" (using the wording above) where a combination of project maintainers could collaborate on code that is essentially the intersection of their projects?  external extensions and testengines are going to be documented in the junit 5 wiki per issue https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/297 and given the collaboration demonstrated by this thread maybe the whole question is mootin any case thanks for all the hard work thats gone into both projects! || @smoyer64 you got lucky we are working hard on releasing mockito 20 :smile: i am not sure what the stance is of the junit team regarding such extensions could you open an issue on junit5 to discuss where such extensions should be placed? || @timvdlippe the question has been posed to the junit 5 team in issue https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/321  @sbrannen is a member of that team so im guessing hes already seen the question )  and im just one of those pesky users (trying to help identify use cases and stress-test the new code)! || thanks a lot looking forward to their response || "";1;0;add parameter elementtype to @mock;"

motivation: - mockito should promote only one api to initialize annotated fields cause it may confuse users what to choose when (runners vs rule) - `mockitorule`does the same as the runners but is more flexible cause it allows to uses other runners eg for parameterized tests which is a often requested feature || i do not think we should deprecate them junit (4) still has runners as a non-deprecated feature we should deprecate the runners once they do the same a lot of people still rely on old junit versions where runners are the only option we can however add proper documentation that indicates that runners should be the second choice || @raphw even if i disagree at some points i accept the core-team decision > a lot of people still rely on old junit versions where runners are the only optioni see you point but i think that people that update to mockito 2x can also update there junit version also deprecating doesnt mean that it is removed in 20 it will still be usable and indicate that a better alternative exist > we can however add proper documentation that indicates that runners should be the second choicegood idea here we go #531 || the reason to deprecate this runner is because the new mockito runner is strict and is a lot more userfriendly than this runner to promote the strict runner we should deprecate this one and use the strict version imoregarding runners vs rules: we can state our preference but we should keep the possibility || ill tidy up the verbose runner documentation i dont think it is useful given the work on #384 and #401 || ok deprecation sounds good to me however id remove `whitebox` its internal after alllets just replace the methods in `junitfailurehacker` at [line 19](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/491/files#diff-a041e60ee2d1a736352af1c34c19b1f4r19) and at [line 26](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/491/files#diff-a041e60ee2d1a736352af1c34c19b1f4r26) by private methods || rebased and updated pull request with feedback ptal :smile:  || indeed the timeout test is picky especially with openjdk 6 i restarted the job 2 times || verbose runner and console spamming runner are now both deprecated lets kill them in 30 :) ||;support for junit 5 (junit lambda);i think we should support junit 5 with mockito 2 currently we maintain an optional dependency on junit four but the junit 5 api is completely incompatible to the old one i already explored the extension mechanism a bit and for our use case it is quite trivialthere are some caveats with junit 5 for example the possibility to reuse a test instance what would require us to extend the rule for reseting mocks between runs but it is more than doable actually i suggest making `@mock` a meta annotation this way we can completely drop the mockitojunitrunner runner and the mockitojunit rule and make the setup even easierthe junit 5 api is still in alpha how do we do this?;junit 5 seems to support only java 8 is its api java 7 compatible?

issue is a follow up of the work started in #141 by @pimterry also heres an extract of a message on [this thread](https://groupsgooglecom/forum/#!topic/mockito/8_wgbb3jbtk) of the mailing list :---the origin of these methods is they come from `anything` ie anything matches later for shortness and cast avoidance the aliases grew but the api naming thus became inconsistent with what a human would expect so this behavior is being changed in mockito 2 beta to be precise heres the status on these api in the version 205-beta :- `any` `anyobject` `any(class)` wont check anything (at first they were just aliases for _anything_ and for cast avoidance) `null` is a valid value- `anyx` like `anystring` will check the arg is not `null` and that has the correct type- `anylist` will check the argument is not null and a `list` instance- `anylistof` (and the likes) at the moment are just aliases to their non generic counter part like `anylist`note this is work in progress (started here in [#141](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/141)) these new behavior can / will change in the beta phase im especially wondering if the `any` family should allow `null` and if not do a type check for example with these matchers : - `any` `anyobject` stay the same they currently allow `null` and dont have to do type check anyway- `any(class)` currently allows `null` and doesnt do type check > allows `null` and if not checks for the given type- `any<collection>of` currently doesnt allow `null` and does a type check of the collection not elements > allows `null` if not checks collection type if not empty checks element typemaybe extend/create a _symmetric_  `isa` family api that wont allow any `null` arguments---;""`any` family is currently _(at his time up to 205-beta)_ inconsistent on the way they allow or not `null`s type checking is ok but `null` check behavior consistency is also important || anyx gramtaically tends to imply to return false for null because anyobject is not null

https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/194#issuecomment-89842760 || i see anystring() ( and friends ) checking for null and anyobject() not doing it as an inconsistency potentially leading to user surprise object is as much of a class as string ( or other )other thing is i fail to see is the difference ( if there is any ) between isa(klazz) and notnull(klazz) ( or isnotnull but i see that one is a forwarder ) to me they seem they do the same given the docs but the code is different and im not familiar enough with it to assert they do the same thing when doing dsl helper libraries ive found ( the hard way ) having slightly different names for the same thing seems a good idea initially but leads to problem along the way so i would vote for just having one of notnull/isnotnull ( and isa if it is functionally equivalent ) || i think there might be confusion here: @szczepiq i dont think the two of you are agreeing @bric3 seems to be saying that `any` should match nulls and anynotnull should exist (and presumably not match null) while youre saying that `any` should not match nulli think the problem here is that theres two use cases that currently arent clearly separated both of which we need to support1 i dont care what the value im matching is _at all_ i want a very simple intuitive wildcard matcher that will match absolutely anything and will compile with no extra effort (so no casts)2 i care about the type of the value that im matching but no details beyond that i want a matcher that will not match values with the wrong typei think both of these are major common use cases if we make any of the `anyx()` methods reject nulls they no longer support the first case and if we leave it as-is then they currently appear to support the 2nd case but arent really doing so which is where all this came from originallyi do think any api that supports use case 2 should reject nulls by default: if youre asserting specifically on the type of the value we should push people to be clear about whether or not null is valid in the given case i think an api for use case 1 should not reject nulls because you want to match _everything_these are two quite different apis though and to get any kind of api consistency were going to need them to be separate sets of methods i suggest:- `any()` - matches absolutely anything including nulls as a generic method returning t (as now)- `anyasx()` and `anyas(xclass)` - matches absolutely anything including nulls as a generic method returning x  - this is as in 19 but with the names changed to make it clear that this is purely a type casting concern not type checking and intentionally being a bit more verbose to discourage unnecessary use  - note that as of java 8 target type inference considers method arguments so you should be able to use `any()` in every case except choosing between overloaded methods (pretty rare?) in addition note that java 7s final update is this month and then its unsupported  - wed also obviously document that users should prefer isa etc if they want to check the type but i think its much more obvious that `anyasstring()` isnt actually checking the values a string (unlike `anystring()` which did suggest that)- `isa/isan(xclass)` and `isanx()` - matches on type rejecting nulls- `isnulloran(xclass)` and `isnulloranx()` - matches on type accepting nullsi think this makes for a relatively small change so gives fairly easy migration but makes it clear that the `any()` methods are all just generic wildcards (for use case 1) and provides a clear set of other methods to support actual type checking and pushing users to be clear about nullability along the way (for use case 2)the only other option i can see we might want to do is stop supporting use case 1 entirely make everybody be much more specific about what they want and reject nulls everywhere i think use case one is likely to be the most common case for use argument matchers anywhere though far more than anything else and we definitely definitely need to support it as an intuitive easy first-class citizenthoughts? do people agree both use cases are common and important? does anybody have a better solution to help us get both while keeping a sensible consistent api? || on tue apr 7 2015 at 5:12 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> these are two quite different apis though and to get any kind of api>

have a better solution to help us get both while keeping a sensible> consistent api?â€‹i agree all are used and importantsim still struggling with the difference between `isnullor(xclass)` and `anyas(xclass)` the only difference i see is if i have a class `a` with a subclass `suba` and a class `b` with a subclass `subb` and a couple of methods `m(a)` and `m(b)` is that `m(anyas(subbclass))` will select `m(b)` and match on a `b` but `m(isnullor(subbclass)` will select it and match only on a `subb` so i could have a broader matcher for `m(isnullor(bclass))`even if this is the case i would just suppress the `anyas(xclass)` as my contrived example could be better written as `anyas(bclass)` in which case i would rename isnullor to any and isa to anynotnull in the naming side i find `any()` â€‹natural `anyas` forced as i consistently read `any(xclass)`as _any thing which can be assigned to a variable of type x_so i would end up with only two method names any and `anynotnull` with a parameterless plus a class parameter variant ( discounting typeing helpers like `anynotnullstring`) which would work:1 `anynotnull` in any variant does not accept nulls any does2 a parameterless `any()`/`anynotnull()` is equivalent to the same method with the declared parameter class note if you can use `any[notnull]()` in the methods there are no overloads and the language guarantees i cannot use an incorrect typeso if i have a method `m(list l)` `m(any(arraylistclass))` would match anything which can be stored in an `arraylist` var subclasses and `null` included and `anynotnull(arraylistclass)` will need a not null one `m(any())` would exactly as `m(any(listclass))` mockito cannot check it but i cannot write code to call `m` with a non-list argument java is type checked same goes for `anynotnull`otoh if i have `m(set s)` too i must use `m(any(setclass))` or `m(any(listclass))` just to resolve the overload although in this case the matcher type checking is superfluousi do not see the point on `any(xclass)` not checking the type and having `isa(xclass)` which does it seems confusing to me so my proposal is basically zapping any of the variants i mean from the description in the overloaded method `m(any(arraylistclass))` will select the list variant butmatch a call with any `list` subtype while `isnullor(arraylistclass)` will only match `arraylist`s ? i do not see this has any real use ( the parameter type must be accessible in the test if you want any list use `isnullor(listclass)`)maybe im missing something but i see `any(xclass)` redundant better served by `isnullor` the rest is just naming disagreementâ€‹francisco olarteâ€‹ || the issue with getting rid of `anyas(xclass)` is that we want two things:- a way to match an argument without checking anything about its value (any)- a way to match an argument and check its type (isa)i think your solution is to just use `any()` with no parameter everywhere to cover the first case and specify the type when you want the 2nd case that wont work because target type inference doesnt work for method arguments in java < 8 so its impossible to use any() without an argument (unless the parameter is just `object` typed)specifically in java 7 the below wont compile:``` javaclass x {   public bool method(list l) {  }}x x  mock(xclass)// error: method(javacollectionslist) cannot be applied to (javalangobject)when (xmethod(any())thenreturn(true)```anybody on java < 8 has to specify the type every time they match anything or its impossible to make it compile they can never really use `any()` they always have to use `any(xclass)` (or equivalent) we need a way in java 7 that you can say match absolutely anything please that compiles and i think `any(xclass)` or equivalent is the only optionif you make that `any(xclass)` matcher check the type (as you suggest) then it no longer matches everything any more and it becomes impossible to wildcard match everything in java < 8 (without casting but that would be pretty nasty)therefore if you want to be able to both match specific types and wildcard match everything in java < 8 you have to have two separate apis to do so the names of those apis need to clearly tell the user which of those two things theyre doing (match anything but cast the matcher to make it compile vs match only this type)i dont think thats avoidable im very happy to take better suggestions for `anyas(xclass)` that make it clearer its just a convenient casting method (without making it so nasty that it stops being convenient) but that method does still need to exist i thinkin addition to all that: wed rather the match a specific type matcher didnt accept nulls by default (as your `any(listclass)` does) we need to make people opt in to matching nulls because its good practice and because theres some potentially confusing behaviour there as nulls are kind of outside the type system we also cant have the wildcard matcher reject nulls or its not matching everything any more thus again they need to be two different methods || hi tim:on tue apr 7 2015 at 7:37 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> the issue with getting

anyas(class) + isa(class) + isnullora(class) (- notnull() which is in another place ) i propose to remove anyas  given it does not check type rename isa(class) to anynotnull(class)  rename isnullora(class) to any(class) and rename ( or forward )  notnull() to anynotnull()> specifically in java 7 the below wont compile:> > class x {>    public bool method(list l) {  }> }> > x x  mock(xclass)> > // error: method(javacollectionslist) cannot be applied to (javalangobject)> when (xmethod(any())thenreturn(true)perfect in this case you use the propossed isnullora(class) which iproposed to rename as any(class)also just grepped and got this from one of my test files:```    ac1  mock(autocallerclass)    when(ac1makecall((accallrequest) any()))thenreturn(resp1)```in case you wonder autocaller is an interface with a method""""makecallresponse makecall(accallrequest)"""" not overloadedi think this is clearly superior in java 7 ( im unable to use java 8on those projects due to problems with the app server ) the any()conveys the i do not care just make this compile and the castclearly says this is due to one of those java 7 shortcomings to me> anybody on java < 8 has to specify the type every time they match anything or its impossible to make it compile they can never really use any() they always have to use any(xclass) (or equivalent) we need a way in java 7 that you can say match absolutely anything please that compiles and i think any(xclass) or equivalent is the only optionwhich is what i proposed you have isnullora(class) which coversthis correct me if wrong> if you make that any(xclass) matcher check the type (as you suggest) then it no longer matches everything any more and it becomes impossible to wildcard match everything in java < 8 (without casting but that would be pretty nasty)it is the method has a declared argument type of list which meansthe compiler will check that when you use the mock inxmethod(whatever) whatever implements list so isnullora(listclass)or any(listclass) will allways match whatever with an extraredundant type check> therefore if you want to be able to both match specific types and wildcard match everything in java < 8 you have to have two separate apis to do so the names of those apis need to clearly tell the user which of those two things theyre doing (match anything but cast the matcher to make it compile vs match only this type)as i said im not knowdledgeable enough and havent got timepresently to dig through the sources if any(listclass) matches wheni pass an arraylist to the mock i can always wildcard by using thedeclared argument type> i dont think thats avoidable im very happy to take better suggestions for anyas(xclass) that make it clearer its just a convenient casting method (without making it so nasty that it stops being convenient) but that method does still need to exist i thinkforget about my proposed renaming with the any/anyas/isa/isnulloraproposal is there any case in which you must use anyas() which cannotbe solved by using isnullora(xclass)? i think they are synonims theproblem i see with anyas as stated is that in the previous example (without overloads ) i could code a matcher aswhen(xmethod(anyas(arraylistclass))) and it shoud fire ( as it doesnot check type ) when i do xmethod(new linkedlist()) i think this isconfusing and asking for problem and by making it check the type icould make when(xmethod(anyass(arraylistclass))) to catch onespecific thing and after that add when(xmethod(anyas(listclass)) fora catch all in java<8 or just plain any() in >8my proposal of getting rid of anyas can be read the other way makeanyas() check type and get rid of isnullorarepeating my self i proposed to get rid of anyas(class) as a i feelit seems to match something which it does not and it cannot doanything which cannot be done with isnullor(class) name it whateveris the functionality with worries me> in addition to all that: wed rather the match a specific type matcher didnt accept nulls by default (as your any(listclass) does) we need to make people opt in to matching nulls because its good practice and because theres some potentially confusing behaviour there as nulls are kind of outside the type system we also cant have the wildcard matcher reject nulls or its not matching everything any more thus again they need to be two different methodsthats another thing what i propose is to simplify so i have twonames ( anyincludingnull anynotnull ) which indicate wether null isaccepted plus two overrides no parameters and a class parameter thenull accepting behaviour is functionaly equivalent to haven just aname plus a boolean parameter ( notreallyany(boolean acceptnull) +notreallyany(boolean acceptnull class klass) )what makes me feel uncorfortable with the proposal is :- too many names i think two suffice- different names for similar methods similar names for different  null accepting behaviourgiven this i think:- anyincludingnul() anyincludingnul(class) anynotnull()  anynotnul(class) cover all cases for jdk <8 & 8 ( although  parameterless ones are not too useful in <8 ) ( your example would be  served by when(xmethod(anyincludingnull(listclass)) )- names should be kept paired you state opting in for nulls is good  practice ill accept that without discussion you say people should  opt in to use them i accept thas as a precondition writing  anyincludingnull is for me opting inbut then we want any() its nice sounds good it is short readsgood (any() in 8 i do not care just need this to compileany(listclass) in 7 i do not care but well then writing any( isopting in to use nulls so the class version should begin with any(too i have no problem with having the null accepting versionsnondefaultacceptingnullsanymatcher and the other one any orisa ides are really good at completing and i can easily manage acouple of names but having any anyas isa isnullora and notnullhorrifies mewell thats all for today i hope it clarifies my positionregards    francisco olarte || ok i think that mostly makes sense although im not clear exactly what the full api youre proposing is that fits the requirements here your last paragraph seems to contradict the four methods youve suggested just abovei think youre still suggesting an `any()` method with actively different behaviour to an `any(xclass)` method though inconsistencies between those two are how we ended up here because one does active type matching and the other doesnt and you need different null matching behaviour too in addition you definitely need `any()` or itll be confusing so i dont think theres any way you can have an `any(xclass)` method that does actual matchingsounds like there is a route through though: what happens if we accept that java 7 is on the way out stick only to casts and stop making the api confusing just to support now unsupported java versions? that would give an api of:- `any()` - matches anything- `isa(xclass)` - matches things with x type not nulls- `isnullora(xclass)` - matches things with x type or nullsif youre using java 8 all is good simple and clear if youre using java 7 you have to cast `any()` but `(myclass) any()` is clearer about what its doing than anything else we have here actually shorter than `any(myclassclass)` anyway and good ides will automatically suggest the cast for you too so pretty easy to find for newbies null behaviour is also clear here and were pushing people to be explicit about whether they match nulls in all arguments they care abouthow does that sound to everybody? || hi tim:on wed apr 8 2015 at 8:38 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> ok i think that mostly makes sense although im not clear exactly what

argument or different names for 2 you need a classargument to check against so in your proposal you would have:- accept nulls do not check class:  any() used as is in java 8  casted in 7 ( or for overload resolution in 8 )- accept nulls check class: isnullora(class)- reject nulls do not check class: notnull() ( same comments as any )- reject nulls check class: isa(class)which is fine dandy for me ( the naming stuff is trivial to achieveusing a franciscoolarteadditionalmatchers helper class )basically you can have a makematcher(boolean acceptnulls class klass) and then any()makematcher(true

matches anything including nulls- `notnull()` matches anything except nulls- `isa(xclass)` matches things of x type except nulls- `isnullora(xclass)` matches things of x type including nulls- we get rid of every other variant (`anystring()` `isnotnull()` etc)i think there are some other extra variants we will still need for things like generic list type checks and varargs but those should follow on fairly cleanly from these thoughts? || hi time:on thu apr 9 2015 at 6:34 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> i agree with francisco if were going for casts i dont think we can have any(stringclass) still exist because we cant make it usefully be consistent with any() i think just isa works fine for that case though and i find it quite readable and clearok> i do marginally prefer notnull() to anynotnull() just because its shorter and simpler i think when(omethod(notnull() notnull())) reads easier than when(omethod(anynotnull() anynotnull())) and while anynotnull makes sense in relation to any its less clear what it does when you see it standalone notnull however is very clear indeedok i donot agree with the arguments but i feel voting for notnull nowis much better than following the thread i retract all my proposalsfor anynotnull--- aside---> it also doesnt feel quite so much like any and notnull are the same family as much as isa/isnullora are just because any is kind of a special case (any + specific values are all people will probably use 1/2 the time i expect)> i think if you place them in a square it does isa is nw isnullora> is ne any is se Â¿ which one goes into sw ?

i think the conclusion of the above discussion is that we cant have an `anyint()` method without breaking the api: either `anyint()` actively matches the type and rejects null (confusingly inconsistent with `any()`) or it doesnt and its confusing and people use it wrong (the current state of affairs)for java 8 `any()` should work everywhere i think and for java 7 you can use `(int) any()` i cant easily test this right now is there something about primitives generics and our implementation that means this doesnt work? thats going to be a difficult problem to solve if sofor `anint()` on the other hand it doesnt actually make the api inconsistent if we do add that as another method so thats very doable not clear why we need it in this case either thoughdo you have an example that doesnt work with this as given?

(if left undecided were effectively deciding on option 4) || i would like to suggest introducing the isa api alongside any the latter would accept nulls while the former would rejecet themnulls are pretty common as values so we ahould not make this more difficult than necessary also tgis makes migration easier || i already started the work on this a few days ago and i chose to kinda follow option 2 as well heres the plan :- `<t> t any()` that accepts anything including `null` i am pondering the addition of `anything` as it is the original meaning of `any`- `* any*()` / `<t> any(t)` will be aliases of `<t> isa(t)` **this is the expected behaviour by users** doing this will introduce the rejection of `null` with java 8 i saw young developer to switching to `any()` when `null` values where used instead of `anyint`since we want to do a release candidate i suggest that we ship the _null safe_ `any*` and remove the `null` check if too much people complaincc @timvdlippe @marcingrzejszczak @raphw @szpak  || thanks for feedback!+1 to your plan-1 to anything it feels that it does not add sufficient value its alonger alias - not sure why would someone want to use iton mon jul 25 2016 at 10:10 am brice dutheil notifications@githubcomwrote:> i already started the work on this a few days ago and i chose to kinda> follow option 2 as well heres the plan :> - <t> t any() that accepts anything including null i am pondering the>   addition of anything as it is the original meaning of any> - \* any_() / <t> any(t) will be aliases of <t> isa(t) *this is the>   expected behaviour by users_ doing this will introduce the rejection>   of null with java 8 i saw young developer to switching to any() when>   null values where used instead of anyint> > since we want to do a release candidate i suggest that we ship the _null> safe_ any* and remove the null check if too much people complain> > cc @timvdlippe https://githubcom/timvdlippe @marcingrzejszczak> https://githubcom/marcingrzejszczak @raphw https://githubcom/raphw> @szpak https://githubcom/szpak> > â€”> you are receiving this because you were mentioned> reply to this email directly view it on github> https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/194#issuecomment-235017691> or mute the thread> https://githubcom/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/aabgp-nrlrlhkpwit9xzjvovbwlnnglbks5qzo3wgajpzm4d6d0z>  || +1 i agree lets try this for the rc || "";1;0;adds deprecation for generic method to avoid casting as it is not anymore necessary in java 8;"

omit `this` before method calls - if necessary provide the class for static method call || respectful -1i like when the class formally declares collaborators instead of calling out to static methods this makes it easy to reason about the code i dont need to read every line of code in the class to find out external couplings realized via static methods i can see the couplings via fields i can easily query how the field variable is used etc another use case is when we discover missing/incorrect unit test coverage (or we do some larger refactorings) and we cannot easily write tests because code is too proceduralthe benefits for converting to static utilities have minimal significance to me yet there is a downside i care about (eg maintainability of procedural code static methods that consume static methods that consume static methods)hence i down vote this sort of changes going down this path all stateless classes in mockito would become static utilities :)you can get +1s from other maintainers and have your changes merged -

i just had a quick look and there are two unit tests failing which seems related to the way you refactored the previous stubbing of the `reporter`i should have checked more thoroughly before merging hopefully you can fix the problem soon alternatively i will just rollback the one commit (the first one is good) and we can reapply the patch once you fixed the two unit tests thank you really this was great clean-up || i fixed the one test error i push it tonightps: i also fixed a bug in the stack trace cleaner not a biggy but please do not `@ignore` tests especially in big commits it is easy to miss that single annotation || @raphw which test(s) is/are failing? i will fix it asap! too bad that some test fail on a regulare base is it possible to ignore them in the ide only? || you can see the build output here: https://travis-ciorg/mockito/mockito#l254-l269i advise you to run the tests with `/gradlew build` this should work || @timvdlippe know what you mean! the next prs include only one refactored class at a time || i have it all fixed on local but i did not have access to wifi without 22 blocked will commit soon || @raphw can you please reopen this issue  || sorry github automatically closes issues that reference a pr || @christianschwarz if a commit contains a comment like """"fixes #426"""" the mentioned issue is automatically closed by github || @pascalschumacher good to know! i will leave it out for the upcoming prs thanks! || now that we are pulling in static methods i would like to propose a new (linter) rule to make it easier to read a file i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with `this` (and `super` for that matter) therefore if we see `thisverify` we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas `verify` references a static method in this class or an imported static method do you agree @mockito/developers ? || > i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with this (and super for that matter)to me it feels like unnecessary/duplicate code cause `this` is implicit adding `this` before every instance call would create a lot more text and would imho reduce readability eg:`thisdosometing(thiswithprivatemethod())` vs `dosomething(withprivatemethod())`> therefore if we see thisverify we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas verify references a static method in this class or an imported static methodan other option avoid ambiguity is to qualify static methods via its class name  this way you can also distinguish which verify() is called ( `mockitocoreverify()` / `mocktioverify()`)  which is not an easy task when a static import is used || im not coding too much in mockito atm (hopefully now after springone conference ill have more time) but i fully agree with @christianschwarz  imo the best solution is to: - omit `this` before method calls - if necessary provide the class for static method call || respectful -1i like when the class formally declares collaborators instead of calling out to static methods this makes it easy to reason about the code i dont need to read every line of code in the class to find out external couplings realized via static methods i can see the couplings via fields i can easily query how the field variable is used etc another use case is when we discover missing/incorrect unit test coverage (or we do some larger refactorings) and we cannot easily write tests because code is too proceduralthe benefits for converting to static utilities have minimal significance to me yet there is a downside i care about (eg maintainability of procedural code static methods that consume static methods that consume static methods)hence i down vote this sort of changes going down this path all stateless classes in mockito would become static utilities :)you can get +1s from other maintainers and have your changes merged - im not here to block your changes but to give honest feedback i see merit in arguments for static utilities they do not outweigh the cost in my opinion || im mitigated about this as well i understand well that mockito creates garbage but they are short lived and **most probably** wont go in the old generation especially in the test phase yet the faster the tests are the more developers will run them it **may** have impacts on big projects also design wise i dont like much static methods toohowever i dont totally agree with the above points : > i dont need to read every line of code in the class to find out external couplings realized via static methods i can see the couplings via fields i can easily query how the field variable is used etccoupling appears also in the import section  static methods are visible there and modern ide usually highlight this intellij even have a warning if import section is too big just as theres warning if theres too many fields this point should not be the reason to avoid static methods> maintainability of procedural code static methods that consume static methods that consume static methodshaving instance methods does not protect again procedural code---i believe theres middle ground there : -

from superclass or interface;i was testing/rebuilding a project with the latest mockito 20-beta when i noticed a couple of tests had started failing looked into why and was able to reduce the issue to [a reproducible test case](https://githubcom/hansjoachim/mockito/blob/confusedsignature/src/test/java/org/mockito/confusedsignaturetestjava) it looks like the problem is somehow caused by the method signature for `getfoo()` the subclass gets this method from two places the superclass with generic return type and from the interface with a concrete one and this seems to be confusing mockito the test works with 11019 but fails with 2090-beta (/latest head)ps feel free to replace the title with something more descriptive;""i think this is an issue with bytebuddy wdyt @raphw? || ~~@hansjoachim have you tried other mockito 2 beta versions ?~~ not needed i did a `git bisect` || byte buddy overrides the method as follows:``` javapublic string getfoo() {  return (string)

generic type information at runtime    for users of mockito this version brings the following advantages:    1 a mocked method contains its generic type: a mocked method of type list<string> will not be erased to list many frameworks / libraries extract this information and would then react differently when encountering an instance of the mock class compared to the original class    2 bridge methods can only be resolved appropriately when the generic type information is processed this allows for a reliable recovery of """"visibility bridges"""" which are no true bridges and are now reliably mocked:100644 100644 d27873a17388f63c683339dfaa640d35f0ac27ed 72f5bb3fbdf07ea04900c195c46ab3990f91135b m  buildgradle:040000 040000 20affcb117604ba6251e1195c1820ffb09664cec

support it should have bee in abf9851;;tweaks matchersany family matchers behavior;this issue is a follow up of the work started in #141 by @pimterry also heres an extract of a message on [this thread](https://groupsgooglecom/forum/#!topic/mockito/8_wgbb3jbtk) of the mailing list :---the origin of these methods is they come from `anything` ie anything matches later for shortness and cast avoidance the aliases grew but the api naming thus became inconsistent with what a human would expect so this behavior is being changed in mockito 2 beta to be precise heres the status on these api in the version 205-beta :- `any` `anyobject` `any(class)` wont check anything (at first they were just aliases for _anything_ and for cast avoidance) `null` is a valid value- `anyx` like `anystring` will check the arg is not `null` and that has the correct type- `anylist` will check the argument is not null and a `list` instance- `anylistof` (and the likes) at the moment are just aliases to their non generic counter part like `anylist`note this is work in progress (started here in [#141](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/141)) these new behavior can / will change in the beta phase im especially wondering if the `any` family should allow `null` and if not do a type check for example with these matchers : - `any` `anyobject` stay the same they currently allow `null` and dont have to do type check anyway- `any(class)` currently allows `null` and doesnt do type check > allows `null` and if not checks for the given type- `any<collection>of` currently doesnt allow `null` and does a type check of the collection not elements > allows `null` if not checks collection type if not empty checks element typemaybe extend/create a _symmetric_  `isa` family api that wont allow any `null` arguments---;""`any` family is currently _(at his time up to 205-beta)_ inconsistent on the way they allow or not `null`s type checking is ok but `null` check behavior consistency is also important ||

or view it on github> https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/194#issuecomment-89842760 || i see anystring() ( and friends ) checking for null and anyobject() not doing it as an inconsistency potentially leading to user surprise object is as much of a class as string ( or other )other thing is i fail to see is the difference ( if there is any ) between isa(klazz) and notnull(klazz) ( or isnotnull but i see that one is a forwarder ) to me they seem they do the same given the docs but the code is different and im not familiar enough with it to assert they do the same thing when doing dsl helper libraries ive found ( the hard way ) having slightly different names for the same thing seems a good idea initially but leads to problem along the way so i would vote for just having one of notnull/isnotnull ( and isa if it is functionally equivalent ) || i think there might be confusion here: @szczepiq i dont think the two of you are agreeing @bric3 seems to be saying that `any` should match nulls and anynotnull should exist (and presumably not match null) while youre saying that `any` should not match nulli think the problem here is that theres two use cases that currently arent clearly separated both of which we need to support1 i dont care what the value im matching is _at all_ i want a very simple intuitive wildcard matcher that will match absolutely anything and will compile with no extra effort (so no casts)2 i care about the type of the value that im matching but no details beyond that i want a matcher that will not match values with the wrong typei think both of these are major common use cases if we make any of the `anyx()` methods reject nulls they no longer support the first case and if we leave it as-is then they currently appear to support the 2nd case but arent really doing so which is where all this came from originallyi do think any api that supports use case 2 should reject nulls by default: if youre asserting specifically on the type of the value we should push people to be clear about whether or not null is valid in the given case i think an api for use case 1 should not reject nulls because you want to match _everything_these are two quite different apis though and to get any kind of api consistency were going to need them to be separate sets of methods i suggest:- `any()` - matches absolutely anything including nulls as a generic method returning t (as now)- `anyasx()` and `anyas(xclass)` - matches absolutely anything including nulls as a generic method returning x  - this is as in 19 but with the names changed to make it clear that this is purely a type casting concern not type checking and intentionally being a bit more verbose to discourage unnecessary use  - note that as of java 8 target type inference considers method arguments so you should be able to use `any()` in every case except choosing between overloaded methods (pretty rare?) in addition note that java 7s final update is this month and then its unsupported  - wed also obviously document that users should prefer isa etc if they want to check the type but i think its much more obvious that `anyasstring()` isnt actually checking the values a string (unlike `anystring()` which did suggest that)- `isa/isan(xclass)` and `isanx()` - matches on type rejecting nulls- `isnulloran(xclass)` and `isnulloranx()` - matches on type accepting nullsi think this makes for a relatively small change so gives fairly easy migration but makes it clear that the `any()` methods are all just generic wildcards (for use case 1) and provides a clear set of other methods to support actual type checking and pushing users to be clear about nullability along the way (for use case 2)the only other option i can see we might want to do is stop supporting use case 1 entirely make everybody be much more specific about what they want and reject nulls everywhere i think use case one is likely to be the most common case for use argument matchers anywhere though far more than anything else and we definitely definitely need to support it as an intuitive easy first-class citizenthoughts? do people agree both use cases are common and important? does anybody have a better solution to help us get both while keeping a sensible consistent api? || on tue apr 7 2015 at 5:12 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> these are two quite different apis

between `isnullor(xclass)` and `anyas(xclass)` the only difference i see is if i have a class `a` with a subclass `suba` and a class `b` with a subclass `subb` and a couple of methods `m(a)` and `m(b)` is that `m(anyas(subbclass))` will select `m(b)` and match on a `b` but `m(isnullor(subbclass)` will select it and match only on a `subb` so i could have a broader matcher for `m(isnullor(bclass))`even if this is the case i would just suppress the `anyas(xclass)` as my contrived example could be better written as `anyas(bclass)` in which case i would rename isnullor to any and isa to anynotnull in the naming side i find `any()` â€‹natural `anyas` forced as i consistently read `any(xclass)`as _any thing which can be assigned to a variable of type x_so i would end up with only two method names any and `anynotnull` with a parameterless plus a class parameter variant ( discounting typeing helpers like `anynotnullstring`) which would work:1 `anynotnull` in any variant does not accept nulls any does2 a parameterless `any()`/`anynotnull()` is equivalent to the same method with the declared parameter class note if you can use `any[notnull]()` in the methods there are no overloads and the language guarantees i cannot use an incorrect typeso if i have a method `m(list l)` `m(any(arraylistclass))` would match anything which can be stored in an `arraylist` var subclasses and `null` included and `anynotnull(arraylistclass)` will need a not null one `m(any())` would exactly as `m(any(listclass))` mockito cannot check it but i cannot write code to call `m` with a non-list argument java is type checked same goes for `anynotnull`otoh if i have `m(set s)` too i must use `m(any(setclass))` or `m(any(listclass))` just to resolve the overload although in this case the matcher type checking is superfluousi do not see the point on `any(xclass)` not checking the type and having `isa(xclass)` which does it seems confusing to me so my proposal is basically zapping any of the variants i mean from the description in the overloaded method `m(any(arraylistclass))` will select the list variant butmatch a call with any `list` subtype while `isnullor(arraylistclass)` will only match `arraylist`s ? i do not see this has any real use ( the parameter type must be accessible in the test if you want any list use `isnullor(listclass)`)maybe im missing something but i see `any(xclass)` redundant better served by `isnullor` the rest is just naming disagreementâ€‹francisco olarteâ€‹ || the issue with getting rid of `anyas(xclass)` is that we want two things:- a way to match an argument without checking anything about its value (any)- a way to match an argument and check its type (isa)i think your solution is to just use `any()` with no parameter everywhere to cover the first case and specify the type when you want the 2nd case that wont work because target type inference doesnt work for method arguments in java < 8 so its impossible to use any() without an argument (unless the parameter is just `object` typed)specifically in java 7 the below wont compile:``` javaclass x {   public bool method(list l) {  }}x x  mock(xclass)// error: method(javacollectionslist) cannot be applied to (javalangobject)when (xmethod(any())thenreturn(true)```anybody on java < 8 has to specify the type every time they match anything or its impossible to make it compile they can never really use `any()` they always have to use `any(xclass)` (or equivalent) we need a way in java 7 that you can say match absolutely anything please that compiles and i think `any(xclass)` or equivalent is the only optionif you make that `any(xclass)` matcher check the type (as you suggest) then it no longer matches everything any more and it becomes impossible to wildcard match everything in java < 8 (without casting but that would be pretty nasty)therefore if you want to be able to both match specific types and wildcard match everything in java < 8 you have to have two separate apis to do so the names of those apis need to clearly tell the user which of those two things theyre doing (match anything but cast the matcher to make it compile vs match only this type)i dont think thats avoidable im very happy to take better suggestions for `anyas(xclass)` that make it clearer its just a convenient casting method (without making it so nasty that it stops being convenient) but that method does still need to exist i thinkin addition to all that: wed rather the match a specific type matcher didnt accept nulls by default (as your `any(listclass)` does) we need to make people opt in to matching nulls because its good practice and because theres some potentially confusing behaviour there as nulls are kind of outside the type system we also cant have the wildcard matcher reject nulls or its not matching everything any more thus again they need to be two different methods || hi tim:on tue apr 7 2015 at 7:37 pm tim perry

because target type inference doesnt work for method arguments in java < 8 so its impossible to use any() without an argument (unless the parameter is just object typed)i dont think youve understood my solution from the previouslypropossed one ( any() + anyas(class) + isa(class) + isnullora(class) (- notnull() which is in another place ) i propose to remove anyas  given it does not check type rename isa(class) to anynotnull(class)  rename isnullora(class) to any(class) and rename ( or forward )  notnull() to anynotnull()> specifically in java 7 the below wont compile:> > class x {>    public bool method(list l) {  }> }> > x x  mock(xclass)> > // error: method(javacollectionslist) cannot be applied to (javalangobject)> when (xmethod(any())thenreturn(true)perfect in this case you use the propossed isnullora(class) which iproposed to rename as any(class)also just grepped and got this from one of my test files:```    ac1  mock(autocallerclass)    when(ac1makecall((accallrequest) any()))thenreturn(resp1)```in case you wonder autocaller is an interface with a method""""makecallresponse makecall(accallrequest)"""" not overloadedi think this is clearly superior in java 7 ( im unable to use java 8on those projects due to problems with the app server ) the any()conveys the i do not care just make this compile and the castclearly says this is due to one of those java 7 shortcomings to me> anybody on java < 8 has to specify the type every time they match anything or its impossible to make it compile they can never really use any() they always have to use any(xclass) (or equivalent) we need a way in java 7 that you can say match absolutely anything please that compiles and i think any(xclass) or equivalent is the only optionwhich is what i proposed you have isnullora(class) which coversthis correct me if wrong> if you make that any(xclass) matcher check the type (as you suggest) then it no longer matches everything any more and it becomes impossible to wildcard match everything in java < 8 (without casting but that would be pretty nasty)it is the method has a declared argument type of list which meansthe compiler will check that when you use the mock inxmethod(whatever) whatever implements list so isnullora(listclass)or any(listclass) will allways match whatever with an extraredundant type check> therefore if you want to be able to both match specific types and wildcard match everything in java < 8 you have to have two separate apis to do so the names of those apis need to clearly tell the user which of those two things theyre doing (match anything but cast the matcher to make it compile vs match only this type)as i said im not knowdledgeable enough and havent got timepresently to dig through the sources if any(listclass) matches wheni pass an arraylist to the mock i can always wildcard by using thedeclared argument type> i dont think thats avoidable im very happy to take better suggestions for anyas(xclass) that make it clearer its just a convenient casting method (without making it so nasty that it stops being convenient) but that method does still need to exist i thinkforget about my proposed renaming with the any/anyas/isa/isnulloraproposal is there any case in which you must use anyas() which cannotbe solved by using isnullora(xclass)? i think they are synonims theproblem i see with anyas as stated is that in the previous example (without overloads ) i could code a matcher aswhen(xmethod(anyas(arraylistclass))) and it shoud fire ( as it doesnot check type ) when i do xmethod(new linkedlist()) i think this isconfusing and asking for problem and by making it check the type icould make when(xmethod(anyass(arraylistclass))) to catch onespecific thing and after that add when(xmethod(anyas(listclass)) fora catch all in java<8 or just plain any() in >8my proposal of getting rid of anyas can be read the other way makeanyas() check type and get rid of isnullorarepeating my self i proposed to get rid of anyas(class) as a i feelit seems to match something which it does not and it cannot doanything which cannot be done with isnullor(class) name it whateveris the functionality with worries me> in addition to all that: wed rather the match a specific type matcher didnt accept nulls by default (as your any(listclass) does) we need to make people opt in to matching nulls because its good practice and because theres some potentially confusing behaviour there as nulls are kind of outside the type system we also cant have the wildcard matcher reject nulls or its not matching everything any more thus again they need to be two different methodsthats another thing what i propose is to simplify so i have twonames ( anyincludingnull anynotnull ) which indicate wether null isaccepted plus two overrides no parameters and a class parameter thenull accepting behaviour is functionaly equivalent to haven just aname plus a boolean parameter ( notreallyany(boolean acceptnull) +notreallyany(boolean acceptnull class klass) )what makes me feel uncorfortable with the proposal is :- too many names i think two suffice- different names for similar methods similar names for different  null accepting behaviourgiven this i think:- anyincludingnul() anyincludingnul(class) anynotnull()  anynotnul(class) cover all cases for jdk <8 & 8 ( although  parameterless ones are not too useful in <8 ) ( your example would be  served by when(xmethod(anyincludingnull(listclass)) )- names should be kept paired you state opting in for nulls is good  practice ill accept that without discussion you say people should  opt in to use them i accept thas as a precondition writing  anyincludingnull is for me opting inbut then we want any() its nice sounds good it is short readsgood (any() in 8 i do not care just need this to compileany(listclass) in 7 i do not care but well then writing any( isopting in to use nulls so the class version should begin with any(too i have no problem with having the null accepting versionsnondefaultacceptingnullsanymatcher and the other one any orisa ides are really good at completing and i can easily manage acouple of names but having any anyas isa isnullora and notnullhorrifies mewell thats all for today i hope it clarifies my positionregards    francisco olarte || ok i think that mostly makes sense although im not clear exactly what the full api youre proposing is that fits the requirements here your last paragraph seems to contradict the four methods youve suggested just abovei think youre still suggesting an `any()` method with actively different behaviour to an `any(xclass)` method though inconsistencies between those two are how we ended up here because one does active type matching and the other doesnt and you need different null matching behaviour too in addition you definitely need `any()` or itll be confusing so i dont think theres any way you can have an `any(xclass)` method that does actual matchingsounds like there is a route through though: what happens if we accept that java 7 is on the way out stick only to casts and stop making the api confusing just to support now unsupported java versions? that would give an api of:- `any()` - matches anything- `isa(xclass)` - matches things with x type not nulls- `isnullora(xclass)` - matches things with x type or nullsif youre using java 8 all is good simple and clear if youre using java 7 you have to cast `any()` but `(myclass) any()` is clearer about what its doing than anything else we have here actually shorter than `any(myclassclass)` anyway and good ides will automatically suggest the cast for you too so pretty easy to find for newbies null behaviour is also clear here and were pushing people to be explicit about whether they match nulls in all arguments they care abouthow does that sound to everybody? || hi tim:on wed apr 8 2015 at 8:38 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> ok i think

another part of the current api notnull() ( or its cousingnotnull(class) i do not know whic notnull is not declared genericlike any though i think it should be for java 8 )you have 2 choices 1- accept nulls 2-check class for 1 you needeither a boolean argument or different names for 2 you need a classargument to check against so in your proposal you would have:- accept nulls do not check class:  any() used as is in java 8  casted in 7 ( or for overload resolution in 8 )- accept nulls check class: isnullora(class)- reject nulls do not check class: notnull() ( same comments as any )- reject nulls check class: isa(class)which is fine dandy for me ( the naming stuff is trivial to achieveusing a franciscoolarteadditionalmatchers helper class )basically you can have a makematcher(boolean

whether they match nulls in all arguments they care abouti think the null / check behaviour is clearer if you group themtogether somehow ( like ive done above ) as this gets rid of theconfusing (current) anyas(class) also i think notnull(class) must goas what is does is served by isa(class)> how does that sound to everybody?fine for me---------------not a proposal----------------now ill explain what i proposed ( for naming along with somemotivations ) i think this discussion seems to prove it is not easilyunderstood this is only for referencenote there are no functional changes with the proposal above justname reorganizations as i think current names are confusing ( and iknow they are for me but this is my problem and i can solve it )0- get rid of anyas and notnull(class) ( served by isa and isnullora )1- any() - keep as it is2- isnullora(class): rename to any(class) as functionality is verysimilar (any()isnullora(declaredparameterclassclass))3- isa() - rename to

and trying to manage priorioritiesi think we have following use cases:1 i dont care about the parameter2 i care that it is not null3 i care about the type (implies (2))solutions:1) any() perhaps kill anyobject() needs explicit casting2) no special api kill isnotnull()/notnull() or just leave theisnotnull()/notnull() needs explicit casting3) any(stringclass) alias to isa(stringclass) (or kill isa())i think it is ok if only use case 3) offers api that avoids casting egif the user wants to avoid casting he needs to specify the matcher better(which i dont think is a problem)cheers!on thu apr

matches anything including nulls- `notnull()` matches anything except nulls- `isa(xclass)` matches things of x type except nulls- `isnullora(xclass)` matches things of x type including nulls- we get rid of every other variant (`anystring()` `isnotnull()` etc)i think there are some other extra variants we will still need for things like generic list type checks and varargs but those should follow on fairly cleanly from these thoughts? || hi time:on thu apr 9 2015 at 6:34 pm tim perry notifications@githubcom wrote:> i agree with francisco if were going for casts i dont think we can have any(stringclass) still exist because we cant make it usefully be consistent with any() i think just isa works fine for that case though and i find it quite readable and clearok> i do marginally prefer notnull() to anynotnull() just because its shorter and simpler i think when(omethod(notnull() notnull())) reads easier than when(omethod(anynotnull() anynotnull())) and while anynotnull makes sense in relation to any its less clear what it does when you see it standalone notnull however is very clear indeedok i donot agree with the arguments but i feel voting for notnull nowis much better than following the thread i retract all my proposalsfor anynotnull--- aside---> it also doesnt feel quite so much like any and notnull are the same family as much as isa/isnullora are just because any is kind of a special case (any + specific values are all people will probably use 1/2 the time i expect)> i think if you place them in a square it does isa is nw isnullora> is ne any is se Â¿ which one goes into sw ?

i think the conclusion of the above discussion is that we cant have an `anyint()` method without breaking the api: either `anyint()` actively matches the type and rejects null (confusingly inconsistent with `any()`) or it doesnt and its confusing and people use it wrong (the current state of affairs)for java 8 `any()` should work everywhere i think and for java 7 you can use `(int) any()` i cant easily test this right now is there something about primitives generics and our implementation that means this doesnt work? thats going to be a difficult problem to solve if sofor `anint()` on the other hand it doesnt actually make the api inconsistent if we do add that as another method so thats very doable not clear why we need it in this case either thoughdo you have an example that doesnt work with this as given?

i just had a quick look and there are two unit tests failing which seems related to the way you refactored the previous stubbing of the `reporter`i should have checked more thoroughly before merging hopefully you can fix the problem soon alternatively i will just rollback the one commit (the first one is good) and we can reapply the patch once you fixed the two unit tests thank you really this was great clean-up || i fixed the one test error i push it tonightps: i also fixed a bug in the stack trace cleaner not a biggy but please do not `@ignore` tests especially in big commits it is easy to miss that single annotation || @raphw which test(s) is/are failing? i will fix it asap! too bad that some test fail on a regulare base is it possible to ignore them in the ide only? || you can see the build output here: https://travis-ciorg/mockito/mockito#l254-l269i advise you to run the tests with `/gradlew build` this should work || @timvdlippe know what you mean! the next prs include only one refactored class at a time || i have it all fixed on local but i did not have access to wifi without 22 blocked will commit soon || @raphw can you please reopen this issue  || sorry github automatically closes issues that reference a pr || @christianschwarz if a commit contains a comment like """"fixes #426"""" the mentioned issue is automatically closed by github || @pascalschumacher good to know! i will leave it out for the upcoming prs thanks! || now that we are pulling in static methods i would like to propose a new (linter) rule to make it easier to read a file i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with `this` (and `super` for that matter) therefore if we see `thisverify` we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas `verify` references a static method in this class or an imported static method do you agree @mockito/developers ? || > i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with this (and super for that matter)to me it feels like unnecessary/duplicate code cause `this` is implicit adding `this` before every instance call would create a lot more text and would imho reduce readability eg:`thisdosometing(thiswithprivatemethod())` vs `dosomething(withprivatemethod())`> therefore if we see thisverify we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas verify references a static method in this class or an imported static methodan other option avoid ambiguity is to qualify static methods via its class name  this way you can also distinguish which verify() is called ( `mockitocoreverify()` / `mocktioverify()`)  which is not an easy task when a static import is used || im not coding too much in mockito atm (hopefully now after springone conference ill have more time) but i fully agree with @christianschwarz  imo the best solution is to: -

|| yes i like it it does require a rebase though to make sure we have enough coverage thanks @ashleyfrieze for spending time on improving java 8 usability! || @ashleyfrieze are you available to update this pr with the feedback or should we take it over from here? thanks for your contribution! || i should be able to do these code review comments - or at the least have a crack at them - in the next 24 hours or so sorry to drop out the loop blame a combination of github notifications and googles inbox for filtering them || @ashleyfrieze no problem whenever you have time :) || mockito2 is intended for version of java pre-java 8 right?it would be great to have a module that has some java 8 examples of the usage of this expressed as unit tests - as per the feedback earlier on - is there a home for that? || @ashleyfrieze yes it compiles with java 5 @raphw are you aware of a method to run unit tests on a separate jdk version? || we could create a module in the build which requires java 8 arguably we could even make it somehow optional for those people still compiling in java 5 depends on how well the build tool will let us do that or i could create a demo project in java 8 that demonstrates these features and we could put it outside the main build? || one potentially larger impact change within this pull request is to the matcher interface making it completely generic typed - this has raised a question (above) about the removing of an instanceof test (which ill double check) it may also have an effect on migration/compatibility is everyone cool with this part of the change?```public boolean matches(object actual)```is now```public boolean matches(t actual)```which makes java8 happier but is also better than the weird thing that hamcrest was allowingwe may be able to relax it to allow subclasses of t if thats preferred? || im going to have to rebase this against master for it to work on merge one issue is that the removal of `invocationonmock::<t> t getargumentat(int index class<t> clazz)` could cause some issues ill try it out its going to be a few days before i get there || are the stacktrace related changes required for this pull request? i would like to reduce the number of side-effect changes in this pull-request as it is already growing quite rapidly i have no problem with a separate pull request to discuss these changes just want to minimize the risk of merging in incorrect changes in an otherwise correct pr || they were stopping me from building the codei know what you meani could pull them into a separate pull request and then rebase this change over that? || lets leave them in for now but i would like to see the comments of @bric3 on these change are you fine with changing the `stacktracefilter` functionality? || just pushed some unit tests for some matchers - mainly to remove the complaint by the coverage report - but also to verify that my change to the interface has worked || @timvdlippe - please note its a refactor rather than a change in outcome the code of the test has been changed the runtime code should have exactly the same behaviour it ever did though i cant see how that test ever passed its possible that in some configurations that test is not run or that it has no impact on some jvms im building on a jdk8 || ah okay if it is backwards compatible then that is fine by me i thought we were making breaking changes here then lets leave the changes here :heart:  || @timvdlippe thanks my fear as with any noob contributing to an os project is that any change could surprisingly be a breaking one :) || ive one thing left to deal with - the javadoc for `doanswer` with the new functional interfaces for composing answers i can refine that or i can go a step further and add to `mockito` things like```public static stubber doanswer(answer1 returninganswerwith1parameter) {}public static stubber doanswer(voidanswer1 voidanswerwith1parameter) {}```which has been suggested and would make it a lot easier to usecan people give me thumbs up or down for whether this is a good thing to do or not ive made a lot of line changes in the sacred `mockito` class dare i go further :) || one last comment on the `doanswer` other than that i think this pr lgtm thank you for your continued effort @ashleyfrieze ! || this looks really good let us please merge this soonas for writing tests: in byte buddy i added some precompiled class files to the `resource` folder of the project such that they are not compiled during build for each test i then add a regular test that first checks if the current jvm supports java 8 or higher and if so i explicitly run the test using `class:forname` and then triggering a `runnable::run` that the java 8-specific test implements || landed this pull request in https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/commit/14617cc9fb43d2ad4b4eb622b4c720367615608a thank you for your continued effort @ashleyfrieze (and also fixing that nasty test as reported in #435!) ||;1;0;fixes #614 : makes functional interfaces incubating;

we need some time to tinker with this change and investigate impact on the codebase would rather not rush it and it gives a nice marketing opportunity for a good minor release :) || > shall we schedule this for 220?absolutely! we are not time-constrained with this feature it can be any 2x so long it is not 210 :) @raphw when it is ready were happy to consume it! || i already wrote down my opinion on #642 about whether to include this in 21 or not here are some technical details:- yes there were to-dos left lesson learned: never squash commits 330 in the morning seems like i dropped my last fix doing so fortunately i did not loose to much and everything is good now- as for the test coverage: ideally we would add an additional test goal to gradle where we rerun all tests using the `inlinebytebuddymockmaker` this is what i did during development of the mock maker and i only had to fix a few tests that implied that a mock was always a subclass of the mocked type i also tried to capture most generic scenarios in the mock-maker specific tests and i think despite of some corner cases this is a good approximation of the general requirements of a mock maker- i added javadoc for the alias property in the end i want to avoid that people have to name the `inlinebytebuddymockmaker` which resides in an internal package the alias gives an explicit name to that mock maker `mockito-inline` which can be used insteadwhile inline mocks are a brand new feature code that is part of this feature is only ever executed if a user enables it explicitly as a plugin i see this inclusion as more of a preview feature which people with specific requirements should try out we will need these experiences before we can make it a standard-feature and the only way of gathering this feedback is to get it out to the masses i think mockito 2 is the best vehicle for this why i would like to see it merged before going finalas for the additional dependencies: they are very minimal i wrote both of them as any code generation library consumer requires these feature over and over i have written weak concurrent maps and self-attachment agents so many times that i decided to bundle them in small jars which are well-tested and well-documented if mockito was a zero-dependency jar i would agree that we should try to avoid these dependencies but since mockito already depends on byte buddy i do not see an advantage of duplicating the functionality of those two < 10 kb jar filesfinally this feature is ready the only thing that i would need to do for adding this to the next mockito version would be to rebase it on the new release-branch head does this mean we should put out rc-22 on monday too? as i argued in #642 i do not think this is the way to gofor all of those reasons let us please include this in another rc for 21 and have this feature available i really think this is an exciting new possibility that puts the _major_ into a major release || after our discussion in slack i also vote for including in 210 it is a major selling feature good job!it seems that travis still complains and we need to look into testing i can take a look tomorrow to build it with gradle :) || this pr introduces new dependencies which means it is a _breaking_ change introducing breaking changes in rcs is a really bad ideai like the idea of introducing opt-in experimental features so long they are backwards compatible we ship incompatible changes in major versions :) || neither dependency is required by the """"standard"""" mocking mechanism any application that has worked with rc1 would also work with this feature if it is not activated even with them missing on the class loader in theory we could make the dependencies optional but this would require users to add them manually when they wanted to use inline mocks given the small size of the dependencies and the fact that users with size constrains should minimize their jars anyways i do however not recommend this also optional dependencies are typically seen as a bad practice || to be honest i do not understand how a new dependency is a breaking change it does not break any existing user code why reinvent the wheel if someone built a functional implementation you can use without too much overhead? || > this pr introduces new dependencies which means it is a breaking changei dont agree with that statementhowever we can work around the added dependency we can for exemple shadow the necessary within mockito classes || can we bump the code coverage a bit too? we should be able to obtain more now since we run the inline mockmaker on travis || the code coverage is not accurate in this case the inline mock maker copies code into instrumented classes what is nothing jacoco is aware of also the coverage increases a lot when the test suite is run against the mock maker which is however done in a seperate build target (i have similar problems in the byte buddy code base) || hm but we are launching two jobs so codecov should merge the diff reports (which it does afaik since we are getting coverage hits in the new class) || i looked into the code coverage changes even though travis runs the tests with the inline mock maker those results are not merged with the code coverage report all the lines not covered are either:1 lines that are code inlined (not covered as this is runtime code that does not get instrumented)2 lines concerning serialization that are only partially covered by the mock maker-specific tests || +1 || +1 || i wanted to test some methods that were not invoked yet (as reported by codecov) i ran debug on the whole test suite and for example `mockmethodadvicesupermethodcall#invoke` was not called at all setting a debug statement at the start of the method with my test case it is actually triggering (hooray more coverage) sadly the test case is currently ignored because there is an endless loop upon invoking `tryinvoke` on the actual delegation method (since i am using `callsrealmethods`) hopefully we can fix this issue :smile: other than that still a +1 for me on merging we might want to focus a little bit more on code coverage since i think the tools are correctly retrieving the code coverage || +1 to merging ([i wrote here why](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/642#issuecomment-249752547)) looks like the saga will have a happy end after all :)before it gets merged id like to:- [ ] review the pr- [ ] update the docs a bit and push to the branch  eta next 12 hourspsadding new dependency is a breaking change || i want to write some more tests later today to increase coverage and better understand the feature eta this afternoon || good catch @timvdlippe i built this as a feature something along the lines of """"great if we can also mock super method calls"""" but this is not a great default as you cannot call an overridden method outside of a class we should still consider it once we add this to the mockito dsl something like: `withfinals()` or `withsupercalls()`fixed now i think you meant to assert the value being `""""foo""""` not `""""bar""""` || great work!!!questions:1 given that were using instrumentation does it open possibilities to mock the unmockable (like static methods)?2 what is the direction of this change? do we want to make it a default behavior or an opt-in / per mock / per project configuration?feedback:1 i didnt get to the review yet will do later today2 i would like to document better what is the direction of this change and what we expect from the users later today :)3 i think its ok to wait few more days and complete reviews tweaks etc || updated steps to get 210 final out at #642 || hi @szczepiq yes i absolutely think about mocking static methods at some point however i would like to avoid mocking them globally instead i would rather mock static calls from within a mock (i think this is the general use case)my plan is to enable something like the following construct at some point:``` javaclass foo {  string foo() { return """"foo"""" + barvalue() }}class bar {  static string value() { return """"bar"""" }}foo foo  spy(new foo())doreturn(""""qux"""")when(foo)callsstatic(barclass)value()assertthat(foofoo() is(""""fooqux""""))```similarly i would like to add support for mocking constructors which are however more difficult to integrate with the dslwhat i would like to do is to refine `foo` to replace all static callsites within the class with `invokedynamic` instructions such that calls that are done by this particular mock instance are treated as stubs what i want to avoid is some form of _global_ stubbing of `bar::value` but only instrument calls from within the mock instanceas for the direction i think we should make this feature either the default once we collected sufficient feedback or to make it the default for final and non-visible types which could not be mocked otherwise also we might want to add a dsl feature such as:``` javafoo foo  mock(fooclass withsettings()mocktype(mocktypeinline))```the big drawback of inline mocks is that this approach does not allow to instrument native methods and it is not possible to strip synchronized keywords from methods so there is still a reason to use subclass-type mocks || fyi: i do not think the coverage reports are rerun upon updating the pr locally the coverage is much higher now || @raphw it actually updates since my new commits did trigger a new coverage report however codecov is currently down it seems || code coverage is pretty decent now and i think this feature is fairly stable therefore lgtm || lgtm however imho it would be good to have another rc before releasing the final version (more feedback could be useful) in general very nice feature @raphwregarding being a breaking change i agree with @szczepiq that adding a new dependency (**in general**) can **in some very specific circumstances** behave like a breaking change lets assume that a client application uses foolib 100 directly (in addition to mockito 560) after upgrading mockito  to 561 or 570 providing foolib 200 (as a transitive dependency) the foolib version used by gradle will be 200 the client application can have compilation issues or even worse work incorrectly due to incompatible changes between foolib 100 and 200 usually it will not happen but there is a potential risk || @szpak this pr does not change the versionproperties so it will trigger another rc absolutely new rc is needed || i didnt get to this today either i will do it tomorrow and if not dont wait for me and ship this baby! (eg new rc :d) || @szczepiq you raced me to javadoc i was gonna commit a lighter version ill inlcude your change then  ) || @bric3 my pleasure :) || fyi: for extra dependencies theres also a """"runtime check"""" approach code checks the presence of required dependency at runtime and informs the user that he needs to add extra dependencies onto the classpath not pushing for this only mentioning for completeness || classes of the additional dependency are only attempted to be loaded if the new optional mock maker is used there is no scenario where an application has worked with rc1 but would fail with these changes as the additional dependency is part of byte buddy and since byte buddy agent has never introduced binary incompatible changes there is no risk in implicit upgrades eitheris this good to merge by this? || > is this good to merge by this?yesthanks so much!!!the final mocks journey does not end here there are many interesting features we can built on top of it :) also we want to implement #657 || great let us merge this then and get out another rc once we collected feedback we make the mock maker available via the mockito api || after my lecture has finished i can push out a new one :) || merge it @raphw ) || hurray! || hi after adding the file src/test/resources/mockito-extensions/orgmockitopluginsmockmaker with text: mock-maker-inline the tests stop runnings from command line (""""/gradlew testdebugunittestâ€ and â€œ/gradlew connecteddebugandroidtest"""" any suggestions? || the inline mock maker does not work on android || can we print a proper warning in this case? || its already part of the stack trace but probably barried one or two ticks down in the stack || > the inline mock maker does not work on androidany update on this? || there are some efforts by alternative byte code providers to offer such functionaltity: https://githubcom/linkedin/dexmaker || "";;;;1;1;fixed test case that assumed specific error message;"

would be a breaking change so for mockito 3 but the solution might be a lot cleaner still have to tinker about it || so i added some support to also deal with exceptions thrown during verifcationas i see it now we have 3 distinct cases:1 everything goes fine and we have a mocka verification mode and some verification data2 verify was called incorrectly and it fails fast with a mockitoexception   for example it was called with  a null pointer a non-mock object  or it has unfinished stubbing  in this case we can only notify the listener about the exception thrown the mock and the verification mode but we fail before the verification data is even there3 the call to verify was correct but the test should fail because the verification mode doesnt match the actual results i believe this always throws an mockitoassertionerror now we can notify the listener about the exception the mode the mock and the verification data(please tell me if im wrong about the types of exceptions and if there are any others that can be thrown)now we could still have one method in the interface with some optional arguments or we could make them 3 distinct cases where we can put the things that are in common namely the mock and verification mode in an event object so that if information is added we can do so we can also have the two different exception cases have a more concrete type about what type of exception actually occurredother possibilities would be dropping the event object completely or introducing multiples to handle the multiple caseslastly this introduces a lot of nasty exception catching and re-throwing but i just dont see a way around it  || i am very much in favor of two subtypes of a verificationexceptionevent this makes it extensible and easy to reason about + less boilerplate when you use the interface || @liamclark nice write up! i think case 2 """"wrong specified verification"""" should not be considered for now it isnt part of the verification but more a specification error for this case i propose to create a new issue like """"introduce specification error listener"""" in the future this could also address other specification errors like  `when`  matcher  or answer misuse  || see #728 for exposing new new public api for verification || it looks like the verificationdata interface was already leaking from the public api therefore this pr does not have address it at this time (see also #730) its best if this pr does not touch verificationdata type lets tidy it up separately to avoid blocking this prif you choose to exposes new public types (like verification event) they need to be interfaceswow this pr is quite a saga :) || @szczepiq regarding the leaking of the internal api what is your preferred method of me undoing my move to the public package?and im curious why you prefer one interface with one method with a nullable throwable argument over the two single method interfaces?

doesnt this force the user to deal with both cases when instead we could seperate them?for following reasons:- simple solution (i dont think there will more arguments in the future)- nullable throwable idiom is pretty standard (thats how listeners work in gradle for example)- i dont see nullable throwable as a problem to the user - he can ignore it if he does not careabove is recommendation - im ok with teams decision on that mattershould you choose to introduce new event object i do insist on putting it behind a public interface (while the concrete class goes to internal package) this ensures flexibility for future changes to the implementation class and reduces public api footprint (eg we dont expose constructors any unexpected public methods of the concrete class etc)thanks for being persistent lets get this change in :) || ive implemented some of the changes requestedhowever since there was still a lot of different opinions about the api we should expose i have implemented two different versions not sure how to show that here (should i make two prs to this pr?)the first is the @szczepiq version with one sam interface with an event object hidden behind an interface and the event object has a nullable throwable causethe second version is the @bric3 version it has the two sam interfaces one for success and one for failures both have their own event objects hidden behind the interfaces right now the failure extends the success interface to just get the throwable (non-null) cause this seems nice but im not sure if we want the interface inheritance in there since it does introduce some dependency between themwhile i personally like this interface a lot more it does introduce quite a few types and more instance of checking since we now need to distinguish between the two listener typesso how do i share this properly so you guys can have a look at it? disclaimer: since half of it will probably be thrown away i did not spend any time on proper java doc for it || @kobbikobb the tests are similar to https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/src/test/java/org/mockitousage/debugging/invocationlistenercallbacktestjava and i disagree that they are overly complicated we can take a look to improve but lets do that in a separate pr and fix both tests at the same time || @timvdlippe yes they are not complicated but a bit obscure i dont think we should let former examples of """"not so good tests"""" guide us into the future however it is a good idea to do a little clean up for our testsfixing the name of this test: wrong_verify_type would be super easy then we could address other issue in a separate pr? || @kobbikobb once this pr has landed you can go ahead and tidy up the tests if you want to :smile:  || @liamclark> the first is the @szczepiq version with one sam interface with an event object hidden behind an interface and the event object has a nullable throwable causelets go with above its simple and clean it uses an event object as most core devs prefer> since half of it will probably be thrown away i did not spend any time on proper java doc for itplease write fantastic javadoc!!! consider adding a paragraph in main mockito class this is how you promote the feature you wrote it is really nice feature it shows the flexibility robustness of mockito also it pushes us forward in exposing verification api as decent public apithanks!!!lets get this feature in || @timvdlippe > @kobbikobb once this pr has landed you can go ahead and tidy up the tests if you want to :smile:later means never! imho a feature should be complete that means it has the best quality possible and that includes tests javadoc and overall design  what about an extra branch based on this pr?

report @grimsa i dont have access to an j9 virtual machine its probably something related to internal types of j9 that affects parts of byte-byddy (like the one show in the [stack trace](https://githubcom/raphw/byte-buddy/blob/byte-buddy-155/byte-buddy-dep/src/main/java/net/bytebuddy/description/type/typedescriptionjava#l3803-l3851)) so not sure when this bug can be fixed || there are some hoops to jump through to get ibms j9 vm (i assume due to some licensing issue) but it can be downloaded with no registration in a [bundle with websphere liberty](https://developeribmcom/assets/wasdev/#asset/runtimes-webprofile7-ibm-java) (located in wlp/java/java)running `java -version` on it produces the following:```java version """"180""""java(tm) se runtime environment (build pwa6480sr3fp10-20160720_02(sr3fp10))ibm j9 vm (build 28 jre 180 windows 7 amd64-64 compressed references 20160719_312156 (jit enabled aot enabled)j9vm -

is important is that i ran the test on this version and mockito **worked as expected**were running on a fairly old ibm jdk (back from 2015 06) so maybe we brought it on ourselvesif you are still interested in looking into it i could figure out a way to get you that failing version of j9 || ah its possible that early java 8 vm of ibm had issues as well actually @raphw identified issues with early hotspot vm they had bugs that were fixed in 180u45 since its old and a more recent version of the vm appears to fix the issue im not sure its worth the efforteventually we can print a message that can warn j9 users warning on a specific version is possible but the version scheme is confusing to say the least im tempted to label it as _wont fix_anyway thanks for the link im using osx though its always possible to create a virtual box from scratch however it takes time || i see theres some code in `orgmockitointernalutilplatform` that checks for jdk version but i dont see an obvious and clean way to add this j9 version check especially as we dont know an exact version from which it works as expectedid agree with labeling it with _wont-fix_ although you could consider mentioning it in the wiki (eg in [whats new in mockito 2](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/wiki/what%27s-new-in-mockito-2)) || > as we dont know an exact version from which it works as expectedyes exactlysure ill mention it in the wiki closing as wont fix for now || added some info regarding vm in the wiki page and i created a pr that warns the user of early ibm j9 vms || "";1;0;related to #801 : adds a

thing is that the jvm does several thing like to allows a type to match a signature like `<t> t any()` type inference with java 8 cast and unboxing however `any()` can only return `null` so the jvm raises an npe on the cast opcode of course the problem isnt new but more possible due to java 8 flexibility thats why mockito had for a long time the primitivewhen mockito is used with the junit runner or the junit rule theres a `invaliduseofmatchersexception` raised **after** the npe with a message about misplaced matchers this exception is raised because the matchers were not consumed by the mock since the npe is raised first so this exception is correct and can help the neophyte to discover the primitive variant like `anyint()`;i love this change! the description of the pr is really

id love to merge this change! || merging tomorrow morning unless theres feedback thanks @timvdlippe for review! ||;tweak junit rule strictness at the method level;team i would really appreciate feedback about this enhancementthere is a feature request reported - a way to exempt from unnecessary stubbing at method level (#792) the feature request makes sense to me currently if the user wants to opt-out from junit rule or junit runner strictness he needs to do it at the scope of the entire class ideally we can opt-out from strictness at finer granularity level (method or even at mock level)inspired by @bric3 [idea](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/792#issuecomment-265762478) id like to get your feedback about this api enhancement for strict junit rulesexample test class:```javapublic class mytest {    //mockito stubbing is strict in the entire test class    @rule public mockitorule mockito  mockitojunitrule()strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)    @test public void lenient_mockito() throws throwable {        //making mockito lenient only for this test method        //below api already exist but it does not have any effect inside of the test method        mockitostrictness(strictnesslenient)        //rest of the test    }}```pros: - we already have strictness method in the mockitorule api so its not adding any new api - least surprise principle - users might expect this behavior to work but currently strictness method _creates_ new instance of the rule and _not_ change the state of the rulecons: - its slightly not intuitive that strictness method actually changes state (its not a setter);instead of a call to the rule (which i would expect to cause side-effects when i see the code) i think it is clearer to use an annotation on the method something like `@mockitostrictness(lenient)` || annotations are clearer and they are a good idea we discussed it in #792 @bric3 was not in favor of annotationscall to the rule is something we would offer in the meantime before we have annotations long term i think annotations are a way forwardim waiting for more feedback and im leaning to implement this new rule behavior regardless if we decide to do annotations or not :) || yes im not in favor of annotation but im not totally against either however annotation api is to be carefully designed as there is way less flexibility override argument types etc**pros*** i believe a programtic way offers more choice for users and framework developers including mockito> * least surprise principle - users might expect this behavior to work but currently strictness method creates new instance of the rule and not change the state of the rulethats maybe the biggest issue here to bypass this the code will need to have some way to define a global state in spseudo code :```java// formockitojunitrule()strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)public mockitorule strictness(strictness strictness) {    return new junitrule(internalruleref logger strictness)}private junitrule(atomicreference<junitrule> internalref mockitologger logger strictness strictness) {    thisinternalruleset(new junitrule(logger strictness)) // existing constructor but should be another class ideally}public statement apply(statement base frameworkmethod method object target) {    return internalruleapply(base method target)}```**cons**> * its slightly not intuitive that strictness method actually changes state (its not a setter)nowadays people understand fluent api outside javabeans setters or getters i dont think thats really an issue there especially if theres code example in the javadoc || great feedback @bric3ill take a stab at making strictness() method working for us i should be able to use a single test listener inside a rule and make this listener mutable so that it can have different behavior between test runs || a solution could be that the rule also watches for annotations and calls the corresponding method that would require a follow-up pr of #843 wdyt? || >a solution could be that the rule also watches for annotations and calls the corresponding method that would require a follow-up pr of #843 wdyt?i like this idea a lot there are 2 main reasons i like it: - annotation looks nice and clean in test code - annotation would also work with junit runner (when we make it work with runner :) for the runner we cannot change its state programmatically because it is a static instance attached to the test class via @runwith annotation with junit rule the situation is different - we have an instance of a rule during test execution || theres also another option like : ```javarule  mockitojunitrule()strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)// in some code blockrulehandler  rulehandler() // no argument  getterrulehandlerstrictness(stritnesslenient) // takes arg  modify behavior``` || thanks @bric3 for feedback! id rather stick to strictness() method instead of introducing handler() it feels the api is simpler and more intuitive to use || fixed by #843  ||;1;0;updated the javadocs;

i just had a quick look and there are two unit tests failing which seems related to the way you refactored the previous stubbing of the `reporter`i should have checked more thoroughly before merging hopefully you can fix the problem soon alternatively i will just rollback the one commit (the first one is good) and we can reapply the patch once you fixed the two unit tests thank you really this was great clean-up || i fixed the one test error i push it tonightps: i also fixed a bug in the stack trace cleaner not a biggy but please do not `@ignore` tests especially in big commits it is easy to miss that single annotation || @raphw which test(s) is/are failing? i will fix it asap! too bad that some test fail on a regulare base is it possible to ignore them in the ide only? || you can see the build output here: https://travis-ciorg/mockito/mockito#l254-l269i advise you to run the tests with `/gradlew build` this should work || @timvdlippe know what you mean! the next prs include only one refactored class at a time || i have it all fixed on local but i did not have access to wifi without 22 blocked will commit soon || @raphw can you please reopen this issue  || sorry github automatically closes issues that reference a pr || @christianschwarz if a commit contains a comment like """"fixes #426"""" the mentioned issue is automatically closed by github || @pascalschumacher good to know! i will leave it out for the upcoming prs thanks! || now that we are pulling in static methods i would like to propose a new (linter) rule to make it easier to read a file i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with `this` (and `super` for that matter) therefore if we see `thisverify` we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas `verify` references a static method in this class or an imported static method do you agree @mockito/developers ? || > i would like that all methods invoked in the current class are referenced with this (and super for that matter)to me it feels like unnecessary/duplicate code cause `this` is implicit adding `this` before every instance call would create a lot more text and would imho reduce readability eg:`thisdosometing(thiswithprivatemethod())` vs `dosomething(withprivatemethod())`> therefore if we see thisverify we know it is in the current class and the same object whereas verify references a static method in this class or an imported static methodan other option avoid ambiguity is to qualify static methods via its class name  this way you can also distinguish which verify() is called ( `mockitocoreverify()` / `mocktioverify()`)  which is not an easy task when a static import is used || im not coding too much in mockito atm (hopefully now after springone conference ill have more time) but i fully agree with @christianschwarz  imo the best solution is to: -

there should be code to reuse### test coverage- see existing tests that cover """"useconstructor"""" method for- ensure decent informative exception messages  - if user supplies wrong constructor args (wrong types we cannot find matching constructor)  - if the constructor throws some exception (constructors of some types have code that can fail)  - when one uses existing parameter-less """"useconstructor"""" method but the mocked class requires constructor args the exception message should tell the user about new """"useconstructorargs"""" method- what if arguments supplied by the user match more than 1 constructor - either we fail gracefully with decent message or we pick one of the constructors- update documentation to describe new feature update documentation for existing parameter-less """"useconstructor"""" method update documentation in main mockito class if it references â€œuseconstructorâ€- other use cases?"";ive thought about some variant of this feature for a while so heres some feedbackitd be nice if we have some concrete use cases to studyin my own experience i have mostly managed to avoid needing this feature by spying non-static abstract classfor example if the abstract class im spying on needs two constructor parameters i do this:```javapublic class footest {  @spy private mockabstractfoo foo  private final bar bar    private baz baz() {}  abstract class mockabstractfoo extends abstractfoo {    mockabstractfoo() {      super(bar baz())    }  }}```fwiw:1 this is static type safe and refactoring friendly so i find it preferable when it meets my needs2 the constructor can use instance fields or instance methods of the enclosing test object3 the main drawback is that you cant easily construct difference instances with different constructor parameters on the other hand i strive to keep my abstract classes stateless so i rarely need to pass constructor parameters anyway || i forgot to mention that it is possible with todays api to pass different constructor parameters through mocksettings like the following:```javaclass mockfoofactory {  private final bar bar  private final baz baz  mockfoofactory(bar bar baz baz) {}  public abstractfoo create() {    return mockitomock(mockfooclass withsettings()        useconstructor()outerinstance(this)defaultanswer(calls_read_methods))  }  abstract class mockfoo extends abstractfoo {    mockfoo() {      super(bar baz)    }  }}```then just call it with:```javanew mockfoofactory(bar baz)create()```again this is static type safe and ide friendly compared to reflection-based apithe `withsettings()` thing has a bit of discoverability problem and i suppose not many people know they can do this alternatively i would love to have a simpler api like:```javamockitospy(outerinstance mockfooclass)``` || i think that overloading `useconstructor()` is a much cleaner approach than adding a new `useconstructorargs(object)` methodit also makes the method much easier to discover as its right there and the users ide will offer the argument listive coded this approach in pr #935 feedback is more than welcome! || agreed that ```usecontructor(args)``` reads nicerpersonally im not convinced that the dynamic type support is worth the effort it seems to be a slippery slope toward defeating java static type safety which reminds me of the ancient jmock vs easymock comparison where the former relied on type-less reflection while the latter is static type safe if java doesnt allow you to call `new foo(object object)` does mockito have to open that back door (when the enclosing class trick could be used to achieve the goal albeit slightly indirectly)?that said if you do decide to add this feature there are a few implementation caveats that we need to be careful about:* overload resolution its not hard to imagine passing an arg whose static type suggests constructor overload1 to be invoked but the runtime type actually invokes overload2 in other words `new foo(a b) {}` and `useconstructor(a b)` result in different constructor being invoked* generics there is no way to verify that the passed in `list<something>` is actually a `list<string>` even at runtime risking unchecked type errors* visibility what happens if the constructor has both public constructor and package-private constructor both could have been chosen for the given args? || i happened to need to dig up the history of @spy abstractclass in #106 and i found that all my concerns against constructor-args were already stated in that thread and it was clear that @szczepiq is fine with the trade-offso while i disagree with the design decision my apologies for repeating myself over again :) || thank you very much for contribution its really nice work! ||;1;0;fixes #685: ability to mock constructors with argsto quote the requirement:we already support spying on abstract classes by allowingparameterless constructor however there is no support forconstructor parametersthis has been asked about long time ago mockito api is not robustenough if it supports mocking with constructor but not when one hasany constructor parametersthis patch enhances the mocksettings#useconstrctor() method and addsoptional ellipsis arguments that are passed to the constructorthe patch streamlines the creation of mocks via constructors to asingle flow where using a no-arg constructor or an enclosing classare just private cases of this flow and dont require their ownspecial treatment;"

real method invocation or empty/unstubbed value? || i think that depends on the mocked type id say :- interface > use default methods by default- concrete > im not sure id rather not make those default`spydefaultmethod` is wrong because the primary objective is not to spy them || so potentially this is mockito 3 backwards incompatible change (when changing defaults) thanks for bringing this up! || for this thing only this could be potntially backward incompatible yet for this thing only im not yet sure we should change the default between 2x and 3x whatever the introduction or not of `usedefaultmethods` in `2x` im a bit undecided at that moment i may have a better opinion when the code is actually done right now the code base of mockito 2x runs java6 so we dont have java 8 tests mockito 3 (master) is java 8 and well introduce java 8 specific tests || makes perfect sensewe already have code in 2x that detects java 8 up to you how to push that further ) || if starting from scratch i couldnt think of a use case thatd benefit from stubbing the default methods by defaultbut maybe that use case does exist or at least for backward compatibility its too late to change?either way i propose we do not need to add a default answer or anything to mock() default methods in interfaces are much like concrete methods in abstract classes `spy(anabstractclassclass)` today already _by default_ invokes concrete methods unless they are explicitly stubbed it seems natural to me that we just relax the restriction on `spy(someinterfaceclass)` to accept interface as a parameter instead of throwing illegal usage exception as it does today || @fluentfuture can you elaborate on that : > it seems natural to me that we just relax the restriction on `spy(someinterfaceclass)` to accept interface as a parameter instead of throwing illegal usage exception as it does todayyes backward compatiblity is a primary concern yet if the change makes sense and doesnt impact users in a bad way it can be discussedalso maybe we could backport behavior and api from master to release/2x || suretoday if javautilconsumer were an abstract class defined as:```javapublic abstract class consumer<t> {  public consumer<t> andthen(consumer<?

super t> that) {    return v -> {accept(v) thataccept(v)}  }  void accept(t value)}```but that is just because we are having a validation that rejects spy(consumerclass) that validation can be removed because it doesnt hurt even if you spy(aninterfaceclass) and even if that interface has no default method because it will just work the same way as mock(aninterfaceclass)heres a [commit](https://githubcom/fluentfuture/mockito/commit/afdd5ebc32de38d098c517bda32c83e194371574) in my fork that removes the validation and the above test passesby the way i retract my suggestion to make `mock(aninterfaceclass)` to call default methods because then it would break the symmetry with `mock(anequivalentabstractclassclass)` which can be surprising || ah i seeimho spying an interface `spy(interfaceclass)` is wrong even when theres default methods it doesnt feel like a a spy as spy have more meaning to spy concrete codeinstead mocking an interface `mock(interfaceclass)` to call default methods only seems ok and maybe backward compatible although i would like opt-in/out mechanismbut mocking an abstract class `mock(anequivalentabstractclassclass)` should never call concrete code || i agree that the spy() name is kinda misleading for the behavior of """"mock only abstract methods""""i originally proposed fake() or other names but spy() was chosen none-the-lessi dont defend the spy() name but its what we have so there may be some value to consistency || `spy` is a specialized mock that seems to _speak_ for everyone maybe `fake` can be another compelling specilizationat this moment not sure if we will but maybe in the future || heres how i found peace with the spy() name:yes it calls the non-abstract methods which isnt spying (more like fake) but it also allows you to explicitly stub them with `when()` or to `verify()` them so in that sense it can still be called a spy || regarding """"interface"""" vs """"abstract class"""" i personally think we should try not to be picky about the differencesome project scoped or company scoped apis out there arent designed to be implemented/subclassed directly by users for these apis going from an abstract class to interface or vice versa is reserved as an implementation detail changethe worst that should happen with changing abstract class to interface is that a handful of direct subclasses break compilation and need to be fixed to use the """"implements"""" keyworditd be a much bigger burden if all the sudden a lot of tests that used to spy() on the abstract class fail just because of the abstract -> interface changespecifically now with java 8 id expect some abstract classes to become interfaces with default methods because the only reason they were abstract classes in the first place was to be able to have some default methods (for fluent chaining and stuff) || interesting feedback i still have mixed feeling about relaxing spy to allow an interfaceill sleep on it and think about it as your migration use case is legitimateand anyway this address only a part of the original issue || @bric3 can you explain which part isnt addressed in the original issue assuming we put aside the mock() vs spy() naming difference? || @fluentfuture i meant regarding configurability of stubbing default method for a mock not a spyyet the use cases discussed above are defintely additional scenario to account for when we will implement the stuff || @bric3 are you okay with allowing @spy on interfaces? if so ill send a pr || @fluentfuture yes i have worked on it in #906 but i wont have a computer near me for a week still || great discussion +1 to allow spying on interfaces-1 to adding new public api method like fake - it would make the api more complicated just for the sake of a single use case+ 05 to changing the default behavior of mockito 3 to spy interface defender methods by default this way it is the most intuitive behavior users expect see https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/940 || i attempted to update the ticket description to reflect the outcome of the discussion feel free to change if needed || if i were going to add another method i would call it `stub` based on [martin fowlers article describing the 3]( https://martinfowlercom/articles/mocksarentstubshtml)seems like `@incubating mockitospy( class<?> clazz )` more or less does what i expect ultimately finding that behavior though required quite a bit of researchwhether or not adding `mockitostub( class<?> clazz )` method would be worth it i cant say because i dont feel like im familiar enough with the underlying implementation/behavior to know how different `mock` and `spy` are if those are just configuration differences then its probably worth it if theres more to it maybe not if `stub` could `call_real_methods` but only work for `abstract` and `interface` and not be able to do `verify` that would make it different from a `spy` imoeither way more docs seem necessary i might try to put those together for #940  || i somehow missed this ticket mockito should imho follow the idea of defender methods and allow api-evolution without  breaking client code/test i other words if a class under test evolves and calls defender methods on a mocked interface the tests should not fail or should not be rewritten by replacing `@mock` with `@spy` or setting up special mocking settings like `withsettings()usedefaultmethods()`i think it is possibe to rewrite the `mock()` implementation to generate stubbed calls to default methods  without special mock settings  ```javapublic <t> t mock(class<t> type){    t mockmockito_coremock(type)    if (!typetomockisinterface())            return mock    for (method method : typetomockgetdeclaredmethods()) {        if (methodisdefault()) {            docallrealmethod()when(mock)            callwithanymatchers(mock method)        }    }    return mock}private static void callwithanymatchers(object mock method method) {    class<?>[] parametertypes  methodgetparametertypes()    list<object> defaultvalues  new arraylist<object>()    for (class<?> type : parametertypes) {            defaultvaluesadd(mockitoany(type))    }        try {        methodinvoke(mock defaultvaluestoarray())    } catch (exception e) {        throw new mockitoexception(egetmessage() e)    }}```this way clients can redefine the defender stubbings like overriding it in an implementation @bric3 @szczepiq @fluentfuture what do you think? || is it any different from api-evolution of abstract classes?in template-method pattern if the sut calls an abstract method and then later evolves to call a default method that indirectly calls the abstract method the exact same problem can happen no?this kind of evolution has always been possible and its not clear to me that the user always means to only stub/verify the abstract method sometimes the user may just want to stub/verify the method directly called abstract or notit seems to me not the mocking frameworks responsibility to guess the users intention instead if the user wants to stub/verify the direct method invocation use `@mock` while if the user wants to stub/verify abstract methods use `@spy` || > is it any different from api-evolution of abstract classes?>>in template-method pattern if the sut calls an abstract method and then later evolves to call a default method that indirectly calls the abstract method the exact same problem can happen no?i agree if you see it like that they are pretty equali want to avoid that `@spy` is misused to stub in the first place the word """"spying"""" implies that there is something to spy on (the sut) but for interfaces the """"spying"""" make no sense we would spy on a mocked interface >it seems to me not the mocking frameworks responsibility to guess the users intention i agree here too! what about a littel helper that create stubbings that call the real default method:  `mockitodelegatedefaultmethodstoreal(mockedinterface)` || i still suggest `stub` as the method name for that per previous reasons cited || did a bit of archeology #106 has a discussion both about the api and the namingin that thread i argued against `spy`: """"all the use cases i know of for partial mocking dont need spying"""" at the time """"stub"""" wasnt suggested but now i think about it it seems to make sensealthough changing it may mean to introduce a new `@stub` annotation and deprecate `@spy abstractclass` if we are willing to consider the ship not sailed yet || interesting discussion! thank you for all suggestions>the tests should not fail or should not be rewritten by replacing @mock with @spy or setting up special mocking settings like withsettings()usedefaultmethods()you are right ideally the tests only fail when a bug is introducedi have a feeling the discussion is getting broader and i am not sure if still discusses the issue reported :) my immediate reaction to new `@stub` interface and potential deprecation of `@spy` is -1 because i dont see clear value however please formulate a separate ticket with the use case code samples and the team will for sure review it!coming back to the original issue: relaxing spy annotation for interfaces is useful for spying on interfaces with default methods the use case is reasonable and team is +1 to the change do we have new data / use cases that indicate that this change inappropriate?

`#5` || yes this is expected the inline mock maker inlines the code and does therefore not add a stack frame this is a bug in the `unusedstubbingfinder` which should not rely on the stack shape@timvdlippe do you have time to look at this? || thank you guys for really thorough debugging!>this is a bug in the unusedstubbingfinder which should not rely on the stack shapethere is a reason why the finder relies on the string representation of line where the unused stub is declared i documented it in the [javadoc](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/junit/unusedstubbingsfinderjava#l46) hopefully it is more less clear :) im not saying we should keep the current implementation im ok changing it i just wanted to give more data pointsafter reading this thread my gut feel tells me that the stack trace filter (different component than unused stubbing detection) may not be coping well with inline mocking this could also have impact on stack trace filtering in general for inline mocking the quality of exception messages etc@tmurakami you made fantastic debugging effort to nail down the problem can you investigate if stack trace filter needs adapting for inline mocking and potentially submit a pr? || with the stack trace filter i actually did change the implementation to adjust this behavior such that it works i was not aware that the stubbing finder replicated something similar || @szczepiq @raphw i can submit the pr but this problem seems to have already been fixed by @raphwshould i submit the pr? || please submit i only fixed the issue partially || "";1;0;fixes #974: fix to get correct stubbing location with inline mocking;"

:) || @szczepiq sure ill take a crack at it but lets first decide what exactly we want to do first a note - `mock(foo withsettings()useconstructor(new a()))` most definitely works with the current implementation contrary to the comment in the above snippeti propose the following definition which is pretty much what the compiler does when facing a call like `new foo(new b())`:- an argument will be called _better matching_ parameter x over parameter y if the argument can be applied to either parameter x or parameter y and x is a more specific type than y<br/>for completeness sake: an argument will be called _worse matching_ parameter x over parameter y if it is _better matching_ parameter y over x an argument will be called _equally matching_ parameter x over parameter y if it is neither _better matching_ or _worse matching_ parameter x over parameter y- an argument list will be called _better matching_ a constructors parameters list x over y if one or more of the arguments are _better matching_ their respective parameters and the rest are _equally matching_ their respective parameters<br/>note that if the argument list is larger than one argument this is not a total order if constructor x is _better matching_ an argument list than constructor z and constructor y is _better matching_ the same argument list than constructor z nothing can be said about the relationship between x and yusing these definitions we can implement the following behavior:- if no constructor matches the argument list an exception is thrown (as it is with the current implementation)- if a single constructor matches the argument list its used (as it is with the current implementation)- if multiple constructors match the argument list and one is _better matching_ than any other constructor it is used (new behavior)- if multiple constructors match the argument list and there isnt one that is _better matching_ than all the  the other constructors an exception is thrown (similar to the current implementation although the error message may be more precise - see below)ill attempt to clarify this with an exampleconsider the following:```javaclass a {}class b extends a {}class c extends b {}class foo {  foo(a x a y) {}  foo(a x b y) {}  foo(b x a y) {}}a a  new a()b b  new b()c c  new c()// works foo(a a) is called obviouslymock(fooclass withsettings()useconstructor(a a)) // works foo(a b) is called// since b is more specific than a foo(a b) is better matching than foor(a a)mock(fooclass withsettings()useconstructor(a b)) // works foo(b a) is called following the same logic as abovemock(fooclass withsettings()useconstructor(b a)) // works foo(b a) is called following the same logic as abovemock(fooclass withsettings()useconstructor(a c)) // does not work as we cant decide between foo(a b) and foo(b a)mock(fooclass withsettings()useconstructor(b b)) ```if this approach makes sense ill cook up a patch that implements it so we have something concrete to discuss || @szczepiq feel free to assign this issue to me i dont think i have the permissions to do so myself ||;1;0;""fix freudian slip in message regarding issue 685the text should read """"a better job"""" not """"a better join"""""";"

explanatory example: version 265 has major2 minor6 patch51 every merged pull request produces new version that lands in bintray """"mockito/maven"""" repo2 some versions we produce are """"notable versions"""" by default those are new major (300 400) and new minor versions (310 320) in contrast to regular new versions the notable versions are included in well-known central repositories: jcenter and maven centralfor more details see the wiki page paragraph on [continuous delivery](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/wiki/continuous-delivery-details#cd)## action list- [x] - configure 2722 as last notable version because it was the last version published to central- release notes:  - [ ] - detailed release notes link to notable release notes and vice versa  - [x] - release notes inform where the jars can be found (https://githubcom/mockito/mockito-release-tools/issues/4)  - [ ] - link to wiki documentation- [ ] - publish next notable version- [x] - procedure of promoting to notable release is documented - https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/readmemd#how-to-release-new-version- [x] - the new release model is comprehensively documented - https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/wiki/continuous-delivery-details#cdoptional:- [ ] - release notes have clean format (https://githubcom/mockito/mockito-release-tools/issues/3)- [ ] - notable release (target repo) can be forced by commit message## implementation details- https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/wiki/continuous-delivery-details#cd- https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/readmemd#how-to-release-new-version"";""> every minor or major version change lands in bothi do agree for major but for minor i am not sure i think we should not immediately release a new minor version when 1 function was added most notably because we might want to add a range of functions in all separate prs (since they are separate logical units) therefore i would say to not do it automatically but presumably faster than with patch releases eg minor every week published patch every month> example: â€œcommunityâ€ repo has 281 282 283 at the end of the month 283 is promoted to productionthis means that 281 and 282 are never available on production? i do think we should push this for 1 consistency in release versions and 2 if someone finds an issue with a version in `production` he/she can bisect using the in-between patch releases to see which version contained the error> im not completely happy with repository naming """"community"""" and """"production""""maybe `trunk` and `production`?> new version is published under following conditionsi would like to add an override here for to be able to push a new version eg not pushing an existing version to production but publishing a new version without manually editing javadoc to artificially trigger the release mechanismoverall i agree with the proposal just some small comments glad that we are taking action in this direction ðŸ‘  || great feedback thank you!>i do agree for major but for minor i am not sure i think we should not immediately release a new minor version when 1 function was added most notably because we might want to add a range of functions in all separate prs (since they are separate logical units) """"minor"""" version (eg middle number :) is not automatically bumped by the system its us (or the pr submitter) that makes a judgement call to explicitly bump minor version this decision is based on the gravity of the changes we dont bump minor version unless it has substantial changes if it does have substantial changes it probably should be released to mass audience at least this is my reasoning if we dont automatically publish minor versions we can end up with versioning scheme where """"community"""" and """"prod"""" repo have pretty much random versions if we publish minor versions automatically """"prod"""" contains announcable significant versions that add substantial value eg 310 320 330 and occasional patch release like 331 """"community"""" repo would have all changes 310 311 312 313 320 etc thoughts?>this means that 281 and 282 are never available on production?

|| > > in short the answer to your question is yes 281 and 282 will never be in """"production"""" repo> i think for claritys sake they should be pushed it would be weird to browse maven central and see missing versions lets see what the others thinki can think of two popular projects which sometines skip versions:- [maven](http://searchmavenorg/#search%7cgav%7c1%7cg%3a%22orgapachemaven%22%20and%20a%3a%22maven%22) missing versions eg 332 334-338 (and upcoming 350 will skip 340)- [tomcat](http://searchmavenorg/#search%7cgav%7c1%7cg%3a%22orgapachetomcat%22%20and%20a%3a%22tomcat%22) missing versions eg 8510 857 8040 || @arend-von-reinersdorff thank you for feedback and examples!@timvdlippe currently i most like following naming scheme for repositories: """"all-versions"""" and """"notable-versions"""" || this looks good! i agree with the model where minor versions are in release channel (notable-versions) and patch versions are in beta channel (all-versions) modulo hot fixes if patch versions are pushed to notable-versions _at the time they are released_ you defeat the purpose of the release channel your """"notable versions"""" channel would churn multiple times daily againmaybe mockito can push all interleaved patch versions available only on the beta channel to the release channel when the release channel is updated? for example:before:```release channel â€“ 230beta â€“ 230 231 232```after:```release channel â€“ 230 231 232 233 (hotfix)beta â€“ 230 231 232 233```this may go against the principle of least surprise since someone browsing the version history of release channel will notice that suddenly not one but three new versions became visible this may be acceptable if bisecting and keeping full version history on the release channel are important for the project as i said before i dont have a strong preference for this model except to say that patch versions should not appear in the release channel _at the time of their release_ unless they are hot fixes || i have an alternative opinion from everything proposed so far i propose introducing the usage of the `classifier` attribute to differentiate between community and production releases with this proposal the current cd procedure would be left unchanged and consumers who want to subscribe to the latest releases can continue to do so with no changes for those consumers who want to limit the thrashing on taking updates they can do so by declaring a `weekly` classifier the only change to the current release process would to be to release the most recent tag with the additional classifier attached it could be weekly or monthly```xml<!-- current usage unchanged! --><dependency>    <groupid>orgmockito</groupid>    <artifactid>mockito-core</artifactid>    <version>275</version></dependency><!-- using the `weekly` classifier --><dependency>    <groupid>orgmockito</groupid>    <artifactid>mockito-core</artifactid>    <classifier>weekly</classifier>    <version>271</version></dependency>```this could also be inverted to restore the delayed release process to the majority of consumers and allow opting in to the daily/continuous releases```xml<dependency>    <groupid>orgmockito</groupid>    <artifactid>mockito-core</artifactid>    <classifier>daily</classifier>    <version>275</version></dependency><dependency>    <groupid>orgmockito</groupid>    <artifactid>mockito-core</artifactid>    <version>271</version></dependency>``` || @mattnelson that is an interesting concept i had not heard of! i am not sure though if it would be valid for our usecase but definitely worth investigating || @mattnelson interesting idea! at this point i want avoid using classifiers because they would complicate things if you get this working for some project or there is a reference project that uses this method we would like to know the experiences@tinkerware thanks for feedback! || @szczepiq i think we can close this issue as well and direct any further discussion to the shipkit repository? || closing this per rationale in #618 and our implementation available at https://githubcom/mockito/shipkit || "";1;0;merge branch release/2x into sf;"

@timvdlippe is running a recent jdk version a hard requirement for mocking `final` classes/methods via `orgmockito:mockito-inline`? if so please state the minium version needed || @johnjohndoe there is not a minium jdk version for mockito but there are a small subset of errors that are jdk related and fixed in more recent versions i think all versions > 1845 are good enough for this subset || this is failing on 18131 anyways so i dont think it a jdk issuethis only fails with `orgmocker:mockito-inline` but works fine on `orgmockito:mockito-core` i suspect the inline mocker is not able to extend interfaces properly? || if it is also failing with the latest jdk it probably is an issue with bytebuddy-android cc @raphw  || yes its a bug in the inline mock maker fixed in attached pr ||

to me props to the documentation and compatibility efforts! || "";powermock and mockmaker: api change request;hi guysive taken a time for reviewing powermock code to find place where it use internal mockito api id like to discuss what could be done to avoid first think that id like to talk about its mockmaker powermock uses it custom mockmaker which it past was used only for two things: - cache a class create by cglib- return fake `internalmockhandler` for static mocks the first case is no more actual because bytebuddy uses current context classloader so `mockclassloader` is used but the second case still actual but investigation shows that returning fake `internalmockhandler` is required only for one case right now method `orgmockitointernalexceptionsreporternomoreinteractionswanted(invocation undesired list<verificationawareinvocation> invocations)` tries to `safelygetmockname(undesiredgetmock())` finally call comes to `orgmockitointernalutilmockutilismock(object mock)` it tries to get `mockhandler` for mock but it mock is static and its not a powermockmaker then `null` is returned i was surprised that having `powermockmaker` is required  only for such thing if speak honestly i dont have any idea how it can be fixed on mockito site maybe you have any thoughts? the second point its a way how mockito loads plugins  we had some discussion within #1006 main point provided @podarsmarty (as for me main) that if there are two files `orgmockitopluginsmockmaker`  in class path then order of loading plugins are unpredictable such undetermined behaviour could introduce some fluky bugs when for example one plugin specified in project and other in  dependency jar and for example it works but later author of dependency jar make refactoring and change package or something like this as result other plugin is loaded by mockito  and tests start failed  for powermock it is issue because is has own `mockmaker` which is required only if test runs with powermock but unfortunately if powermock in class path it will be used always  if a developer wants to use `mock-maker-inline` to be able to mock final without powermock then it was impossible until powermock 170 where i added ability to specify  `mockmaker` to which `powermockmaker` delegates calls as for me it will be good to have ability to separate custom `mockmaker` and mockito build-in `mockmaker` so custom `mockmaker` could know which build-in `mockmaker` should be used to delegate call if its required;""@thekingnothing do you live in krakow? i spent most of my adult life in krakow )thank you for reaching out to us so that we can work together thats how this should be done - we design the apis between open source components so that our users get higher quality products (eg products that dont break on version upgrade :)im also surprised that those are the only issues with using mockitos private api something tells me there is more

cleaner its not a critical feature without it the errors are still decentto get started i suggest to hack mockito code and return empty string if getting mock name throws an exception this way you can

means to obtain the default mock maker) || > @thekingnothing do you live in krakow? i spent most of my adult life in krakow )yeah im living in krakow for one year nice city except winter time i mean

lot of issue and thing todo powermock has been being developed for 9 years in isolation and there are a lot of hacks (sometimes really dirty)  i started with easiest issue all other could take more

assume you use nomoreinteractionswanted as an example no `nomoreinteractionswanted` and `nomoreinteractionswantedinorder`  its only one case right now all other methods which use `safelygetmockname`

out that the problem is that mockhandler api in mockito is not quite finished therefore powermockito had to create custom implementation of mockhandler despite our javadoc saying:> this api is work in

on cleaning the apis between both libraries!)@thekingnothing if we make the mockhandler api public will this work for you? ive initiated the efforts here: https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1121

`pluginsgetmockmaker()` - internal api call- then to create a mock i have to pass a `mockhandler` to `createmock` i found only one way to do it use `mockhandlerfactory` - one more internal use- to create `mockhandler` the settings is required everything is pretty good with `mockitowithsettings` except that i need to set mock type- the instance of `mockhandler` is used to create `mockitomethodinvocationcontrol` this class is full of internal calls and dirty hacksbtw one of hack in `mockitomethodinvocationcontrol`  as i remember that it replaces a field in `mockhandler` by own copy-past implementation only for one purpose: fix and issue with getting mock name in `tostring()` so `saflygetmockname` not only place with such issue but i think i have to revisit this part of code and double check it if getting mock name works for nomoreinteractionswanted` it should work for `tostring` hmm maybe it will be better to keep powermockmackerbest regradsarthur zagretdinovon 12 jun

powermock uses  `mockitomethodinvocationcontrol` to handle static or non-public method invocation  new instance call and calls to system classes there are two implementations of the `methodinvocationcontrol`: `mockitomethodinvocationcontrol` and `easymockmethodinvocationcontrol` mockito implementation is heavy rely on `mockhanlder` powermock has to have access to mocks mockhandler one of the way that is used now its to create a instance of `mockhanlder` the create a mock with using the created mockhanlder and then pass the same instance to `mockitomethodinvocationcontrol` the second way create mock with settings by using public api then if possible cast mock to `mockaccess` and get mockhanlder both approaches use internal mockito api hmm ive just realized that there is one more way to achieve the same goal create mock with using public api and then get mockhandler from `mockutil` maybe its possible anyway powermock needs a public api to create a mock with settings and then get mockhandler for the mock  || >hmm ive just realized that there is one more way to achieve the same goal create mock with using public api and then get mockhandler from mockutil maybe its possibleyup thats exactly what im suggesting! can you try to go on that path?

:) i have a good news we about to finish there are two places are left in powermock where mockitos internal packages age importfirst place it is the annotation engine: powermock extends mockitos `spyannotationengine` and `injectingannotationengine` classes and use `powermockito` for cases when mockito cannot create a mock im going to rewrite this part and unify with easymock implementation with general logic like 1 call mocking framework engine with public api like `mockitoannotationinit()` in mockito case 1 catch exception and re-throw exception with modified message with suggestion to use powermock annotation on fields that cannot be mocked by mockito1 call powermock annotation inject engine the second place is more interesting powermock has to detect if invocation is already caught by mockito and mockito tries to invoke real method ```/*           * if we come here and it means that the class has been modified by           * powermock if this handler has a delegator (ie is in spy mode in           * the current implementation) and it has been caught by the mockito           * proxy before our mockgateway we need to know if the method is private           * or not because if the previously described preconditions are met and           * the method is not private it means that mockito has already processed           * the method invocation and we should not delegate the call to mockito           * again (thus we return proceed) if we would do that mockito will           * receive multiple method invocations to proxy for each method           * invocation for privately spied methods mockito havent received the           * invocation and thus we should delegate the call to the mockito proxy           */        final object returnvalue        if (iscanbehandledbymockito(method) && hasbeencaughtbymockitoproxy()) {            returnvalue  mockgatewayproceed        }```it has very ugly implementation right now ```    private boolean hasbeencaughtbymockitoproxy() {        stacktraceelement[] stacktrace  threadcurrentthread()getstacktrace()        stacktracefilter filter  new stacktracefilter()        /*        * we filter the stack-trace to check if """"mockito"""" exists as a stack trace element (the filter method        * remove all mockito stack trace elements) if the filtered stack trace length is not equal to the original stack trace length        * this means that the call has been caught by mockito        */        final stacktraceelement[] filteredstacktrace  filterfilter(stacktrace true)        return filteredstacktracelength ! stacktracelength    }```   do you have idea how to avoid such dirty code?

|| @jeffdcamp thanks for the description are you using the android mock maker or the final mock maker? could you attach a profiler when running the tests to see what takes so much time?just to be sure: you verified that 2850 causes the same performance problems? || if you are using the final mock maker i see how the resolution could be problematic using the method graph compiler this is quite expensive and i did not think much about it when implementing the correct solution we should definetly cache the result || @jeffdcamp could you build mockito from the branch `performance-fix` and try it out? i wonder if that fixes the regression thanks || @raphw  we are not using """"android mock maker or the final mock maker""""   yes 2850 is the version that causes the slowdowns (we tried both  2848 and 2849 and those 2 versions work fine)ill try to perform a build of mockito """"performance-fix"""" branch || @raphw i just built the """"performance-fix"""" branch and changed the dependency on our project to """"291"""" and that did not fix the slow downthe following is using version 291 (note the long run times):![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/1479095/29842041-d956de70-8cc4-11e7-9329-a7d1e88f9abcpng)the following is using version 2847:![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/1479095/29842193-58a65034-8cc5-11e7-8e13-9e023502340bpng) || and you really get the same behavior in 2850? this seems unlikely if you are not using the inline mock maker (are you sure you have no mock maker configured?) the only change from 2849 to 2850 is in the class `mockmethodadvice` which should not even get loaded unless you are using the mock maker in which case the versions should be identicalmaybe the performance regression happens with 2849 too? this would make more sense as it includes a major version update of byte buddycould you run the tests while profiling with something like jprofiler (there is a free trial) to see where the tests spend their time compared to before the update? || @raphw i just went to the git log and checked-out and built revision """"fixed flaky bintray badge szczepan faber* 6/22/17 4:16 pm (1a60a8496d4b704cac115608ca67840c7d8a6865)"""" and tests runs fast i then checked-out revision and built revision """"fixes #1135: properly resolve visibility bridges (#1136) rafael winterhalter* 6/24/17 2:29 am (fa66960eeb74473822fe9081246f360964da6023)"""" and the tests run slowill see what i can do to profile || thanks for investigating! this is just super strange i have no idea how this could affect the subclass mock makerwhen profiling with jprofiler run a cpu sample for the `orgmockito` and `netbytebuddy` namespaces || @raphw is it possible that when tests are run/executed in android studio / intellij it might cause mock maker fire off? (sorry i dont know much about """"mock maker"""") || that should not happen for kotlin it might however make sense as most types are final by defaultyou can set a break point in the `mockutil::createmock` method and see what instance of `mockmaker` you have (inline or subclass) to see what plugin is loaded || it appears to be """"inlinebytebuddymockmaker"""" || in this case you are using the inline mock maker to support mocking of final types i am afraid that the lookup of visibility bridges still takes too long i will try to further improve the runtime || awesome!  let me know if there is anything else you would like me to test/try/identify || i tried caching the entire graph could you try the performance-fix branch once more? || its fixed!the latest code on the """"performance-fix"""" branch is back to expected speeds!  good work! || its still preliminary as it leaks memory unfortunately i have to work a bit more with it before merginggood to know that the approach is right though! thanks for checking || let me know if you would like me to rerun my tests with updated code || thanks @jeffdcamp for the report and awesome @raphw to find the fix so quickly :heart:  || does the inline work for you in 290? several tests here fail when mocking kotlin classes but work in 2847 || @paulwoitaschek take a look at the #1183 || "";1;0;#1179: fix performance regression caused by use of method graph compiler;"

> || @timvdlippe sorry i didnt intend to mock list i happened to use the list as a simple example this case happens when mocking superclass method which is not overridden in child class || this seems to be a regression in version 290 with `mock-maker-inline` in our code base we hit the issue with some code that mocks elasticsearch 235s

 mock(deleterequestbuilderclass)assertnull(bget())```this passes with mockito 2847 but causes an npe with mockito 290 because the """"real"""" method is invoked:```javalangnullpointerexception	at

case but i assume it was insufficient to capture the full problemthanks for double-checking i will hav another lookps: you did build the release 2x branch? alternatively the build should be released by now || ah i just double-checked and it seems like the actual fix got lost in git rebase i will fix this tonight! || new try! || thanks! just built `v292` locally and i can confirm the issue is fixed :white_check_mark: dare i ask: since this release resolves a regression do you plan to publish it on maven central? || should be published automatically @szczepiq? || nah by default they only go to bintray (i can configure our nexus to proxy to bintray but i prefer to keep the number of non-maven central hosted dependencies as small as possible also by publishing on maven central a larger audience will find the fix using the `versions-maven-plugin`) || >should be published automatically @szczepiq?we currently dont publish automatically to maven central based on the feedback from community that there are too many versions of mockito around :) we might get back to publishing every version as we did beforei plan to ship 210 soon for https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1121 so

is it last-come wins? that could potentially break any framework that would be relying on the fact that the mock it set is the mock that is executed onthe mock object is created only once so there is no practical possibility for 2 different frameworks to add different listenerswe already have in our api similar listeners that are configured at mock creation we did not encounter a problem with this api the new """"verificationstartedlistener"""" suggested in this pr follows an existing pattern that was already discussed in the pasthence i think its ok to allow multiple listeners to keep the api consistent and simplethank you for insightful feedback! keep it coming because im finishing this feature off :) || sorry for being vague i am okay with adding multiple listeners but my comment was regarding calling `setmock`  multiple times if franeworks a and b both call `setmock` and rely on its value one of them will break (depending on which one is invoked latest) therefore i would like to block calling `setmock` twice if another framework calls it it should be an exception stating that mocks were overridden and there is an incompatibility between two dependencies wdyt? || >if franeworks a and b both call setmock and rely on its value one of them will break (depending on which one is invoked latest)how can 2 frameworks call setmock? only 1 framework can create mock and pass a listener can you describe the scenario more clearly?happy to work out this scenario to design great api! || fyi: im almost done with the code i would love some feedback! || i have some time tomorrow to write down the exampleon sun 8 oct 2017 18:28 szczepan faber <notifications@githubcom> wrote:> fyi: im almost done with the code i would love some feedback!>> â€”> you are receiving this because you were mentioned>>> reply to this email directly view it on github> <https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1192#issuecomment-335018420> or mute> the thread> <https://githubcom/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/afrdb-cvxjmtnnwc7oc3urgcbsb7mndyks5sqpg5gajpzm4ppxj0>> > || due to issues with gradle from #1202 i am unable to compile or do any work have to wait till that is resolved until i can write the example :cry:  || okay so while trying to write down the example i realized it is a bit more tricky it would essentially require to add multiple listeners on the same `mockitosettings` object:```javalist mock2  mock(listclass mockitowithsettings()verificationstartedlisteners(new verificationstartedlistener() {            public void onverificationstarted(verificationstartedevent event) {                //this is a hack to simulate desired behavior                containeradd(eventgetmock())                eventsetmock(mock1)            }        } new verificationstartedlistener() {            @override            public void onverificationstarted(verificationstartedevent event) {                eventsetmock(mock2)            }        }))```in this case `mock2` will be the final mock if the first listener was added based on framework 1 and the second one by a different one there is a discrepancy between the mock that is actually in the event and the mock the framework expects if framework 1 is relying on the mock being mock1 while at the same time framework 2 relies on the mock being mock2 one of them will breaki would thus like to propose that if `setmock` is invoked twice an exception is thrown this is very explicit to the user indicating: hey you are using two framework listeners together this cant work || hey @timvdlippe i still dont understand the use case1 only one framework can construct a mock object if multiple frameworks integrate with mockito only one of those frameworks can construct given mock the other framework can use the mock of course but it cannot create it (because it is already created) if we need to lets discuss this further on slack2 id like the api to be consistent with other listeners like invocation listeners using an exception makes verification started listeners work differently than invocation listeners because it makes the 1st listener more important than other listeners consistent api is less surprising to users and makes it easy to use predictable3 adding an exception adds some complexity that we need to maintain4 there is no use case to support 2 listeners just like there is no use case to support only 1 listener supporting 2 listeners does not seem incorrect if it is not incorrect id rather keep things simple allowing 2 listeners is more open for experimentation and unexpected use cases using an exception is creating an arbitrary constraint without a use case5 if the use case presents itself for example we have a user bug report im happy to add code to address it perhaps then we add some validationfyi when designing this i had considered supporting just single listener but decided against it thats why i have added """"[listeners_are_executed_in_sequence](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1192/files#diff-c7b40da00e36958d90e247ac5f759871r72)"""" testgood discussion! thank you for taking the time to describe what you meant do you have feedback about other parts of the api or the implementation?

gradle scan plugin it seems that gradle 4 is breaking a lot of stuff while gradle 35 is working fine are you okay with reverting for now to then investigate what is going on? || @timvdlippe strange it works on travis as well as on my computer :) what command do you call? what os and java version do you have? || i have tried with both openjdk8 and 9 on ubuntu 1604 it fails on `/gradlew clean build` on `release/2x` and also when i try to merge `release/2x` into `backport-fixes` || im not able to reproduce that issue @szczepiq @raphw @christianschwarz are you able to execute `/gradlew clean build` on `release/2x` without errors? || @szpak are you using openjdk or oracljedk? thats the only difference i can spot with my setup and travis || openjdk on fedora 26:```openjdk version """"180_144""""openjdk runtime environment (build 180_144-b01)openjdk 64-bit server vm (build 25144-b01 mixed mode)```i have just also tested it with oracle java 9 (which after changes in the final version seems to be reported as openjdk as well):```openjdk version """"9""""openjdk runtime environment (build 9+181)openjdk 64-bit server vm (build 9+181 mixed mode)``` || hm i have the latest available (on ubuntu 1604) jdk 8 version which is 131 maybe that is an issue?! would be really weird that would trigger these errors || i installed oraclejdk8 and it is working locally again probably a corrupt state of my computer which was resolved later glad it is working again :relieved:  || "";""""""could not initialize inline byte buddy mock maker"""" with gradle 4x"";""i tried to add java 9

org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/mockmethoddispatcherraw"""" sounds strange@raphw under what circumstances that bb error can occur (even abstracting it from gradle)?"";gradle is supposed to rename the `org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/mockmethoddispatcherclass` file to `org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/mockmethoddispatcherraw` during its build this is necessary to prohibit the class from being loaded by any class loader as we explicily inject it into the bootstrap class loader using the instrumentation api it seems like this does no longer work as the runtime cannot locate this name i guess it was not renamed and is still available under `class` || it looks like this one is failing due to this (https://docsgradleorg/40/release-noteshtml#location-of-classes-in-the-build-directory) change in gradle 40 and the fact that `inline-mockgradle` is using the old hardcoded path || yup that was a problem @raphw thanks @epeee for an implementation hint || @szpak  @epeee  @raphw : can you please help me understand what i should do to make it work in my android project? it has mockito-core and mockito-android v 2210 and also powermockito2 api and the project has both java and kotlin classes i would like to test the kotlin classes  || @hearbeathorror this issue has been closed almost a year ago and it is rather loosely related to your problem i propose you to ask a question using [stack overflow](https://stackoverflowcom/questions/tagged/mockito) or the [mailing

kotlin-lamda-related```kotlinpackage redactedpackagenameimport ioreactivexfunctionsactionimport orgjunittestimport orgmockitomockitospyimport orgmockitomockitoverifyclass mockitotest {    class

:module:testdebugunittest```;fyi the same thing happens with mockito 2100 || should be fixed on master already || @raphw can you please point me at the commit? || https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/commit/9848cec9ebb28791bca565200cdacf337730a015 || @raphw just double-checked 2100 and the issue is still the same ðŸ˜ž  || ah too bad i will have a look it surely is related to our performance optimizations of detecting overridden calls to avoid repeated mocking down the hierarchy || the issue remains when using 2110 as well || i have added a test case on a branch now and started investigating seems like there is some issue with the sefl-invocation check such that the apply call is not recognized as a mock invocation || it seems like this is an issue within bridge method resolution kotlin creates several methods with equal java signature given test test class:```javaclass examplefunctiontest$testagain$value$1```the kotlin compiler implements two methods:```javajavalangobject examplefunctiontest$testagain$value$1invoke()void examplefunctiontest$testagain$value$1invoke()```from the view of the java language these two methods have an identical invocation signature and byte buddy attempts to resolve one method as a bridge method of the other one what is not correct for the kotlin languagei am currently trying to figure out why kotlin is doing that this would also break interoperability from java unfortunately this is not an easy mistake to work around either as we need to resolve bridge methods in order to handle java classes correctly and even with kotlin java classes will always be involved via the core class library such that one cannot simply offer a language switchthe fact that this broke recently is a result of fixing this resolution for java which was necessary due to a bug in this mechanism || just checked the 2120 and the issue seems to be fixed indeed thanks! ||;1;0;fixes #1183: make override check more forgiving to accomondate kotlin compile patterns;

ive been able to solve my problem (iirc i used the `longthat(matcher<long>)` version) so the point of this report is to help prevent others from running into the same issuei dont have any suggestions for how to implement it - the stack trace confuses me a lot and i wouldnt know where to start looking for the problem do you have any pointers where to start? im completely unfamiliar with the mockito source unfortunately || thanks for reporting the issue! it is very useful to build this documentationim not sure if it is feasible to improve the error message in this case eg the implementation of argthat() does not know the receiver object nor the method i used to think that this is not possible however your initial report got me thinking perhaps we can inspect the generic type of the matcher and if it is a primitive wrapper it can return 0 or false we would really appreciate your contribution :)you could start with a failing test case (you have it already) and try to add some smartness to the implementation of argthat method || > perhaps we can inspect the generic type of the matcher and if it is a primitive wrapper it can return 0 or falsethat is probably feasible but this wont be of any use in most cases because most of us use existing _matchers_ where most are generic with an `object` upper bound || yeah it would be good who wants to contribute the fix?on fri apr 3 2015 07:35 brice dutheil notifications@githubcom wrote:> perhaps we can inspect the generic type of the matcher and if it is a> primitive wrapper it can return 0 or false> > that is probably feasible but this wont be of any use in most cases> because most of us use existing _matchers_ where most are generic with an> object upper bound> > ## > > reply to this email directly or view it on github> https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/117#issuecomment-89305725 || is this still an ongoing issue? i am willing to do some investigation on this one || i did some investigation and the problem is at [the generictypeextractor](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/15688023419199b0a27b15a8d782848cdfaa9530/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/util/reflection/generictypeextractorjava#l78)when executing the posted testcase the matcher that is created is [isequal](https://githubcom/hamcrest/javahamcrest/blob/c47a7b873345ee46073707d35c6f0cc847c4baf1/hamcrest-core/src/main/java/org/hamcrest/core/isequaljava)when executing `getactualtypearguments()` on `basematchersclass` it returns `type[] {typevariableimpl}` with name `t` as `basematchers` is the declared superclass of `isequal`this behaviour is because `isequal` is declared as generic with `<t>` therefore i sadly dont see a feasible solution and would alter the documentation to state that primitives should use the other methods such as `longthat(long)` || ah i had high hopes for the type extracting :( looks like the argxxx methods need to be included in mockitohamcrest do you want to contribute?  || i can contribute yes (but have a lot of prs open already might cause some flooding) but what do you mean with `argxxx`?do you mean a signature like `public static long argthat(matcher<long> matcher)`? i am not sure if it compiles but i can try it outstill i dont think the underlying issue is solved because `isequal<t>` with `tlong` will not match the `matcher<long>` but that would be left for experimentation || > do you mean a signature like public static long argthat(matcher<long> matcher)? i am not sure if it compiles but i can try it outit doesnt compile `argthat(matcher<long>)` has the same erasure as `argthat(matcher<t>)` i guess this issue cant be fixed the workaround is to use `mockitohamcrestlongthat(matcher<long>)` or better `mockitoeq(long)`imo this issue can be closed || i agree maybe with future jdk version we could do something not right now thanks @christianschwarz for this archeological dive in mockito issues ) || also remove `bug` label because its not really a bug in mockito || @bric3 please reopen> it doesnt compile argthat(matcher<long>) has the same erasure as argthat(matcher<t>) i guess this issue cant be fixed i was wrong after looking #246 i noticed that this issue can be fixed! two methods dont have the same erasure if the return type is different the java 8 compiler generates a warning in this case dont know about other versions we need to provide overloads for all primitives like this:```public static long argthat(matcher<long> matcher) {        reportmatcher(matcher)        return 0}```for the provided test case the expected `mockitoexception` _""""wanted but not invoked """"_ is thrown || @christianschwarz nope that doesnt work while java byte code allows to have method based on the complete signature (ie name arg types and return type) the compiler just look at the name and arg typesthe following code dont compile : ```long argthat(matcher<long> matcher) {}int argthat(matcher<integer> matcher) {}``` || @bric3 crazy the jdt compiler has no problem with your sample it even works at runtime after some investigation i found this answer on [stackoverflow ](http://stackoverflowcom/a/5562274/932656) it ~~should  worked with javac too~~ **worked until java 7** as the jls seems to allow it due to a hole in the specs (if i understand that correct)also interesting: [with generics the return type is part of the method signature](http://vanillajavablogspotde/2011/02/with-generics-return-type-is-part-ofhtml)but i agree keep it closed for now || this hack does not work with java 8 || jup!its a bug in eclipse jdt that only occures with a non standard jre execution environment and compiler compliance setup i filed an issue for the jdt-team: [bug 499817](https://bugseclipseorg/bugs/show_bugcgi?id499817) || again something against eclipse its not the first bad bug using eclipse compiler-- briceon wed aug 17 2016 at 12:39 pm +0200 """"christian schwarz"""" notifications@githubcom wrote:jup!its a bug in eclipse jdt that only occures with a non standard jre execution environment and compiler compliance setup i filed an issue for the jdt-team: bug 499817â€”you are receiving this because you were mentionedreply to this email directly view it on github or mute the thread || "";1;0;update genericsmockitoannotationstestjava;"

versions againalso travis is unhappy because we are targeting java 8 with this pr since we state mockito 2 supports java 6+ i am not sure if we can integrate into mockito 2 instead we maybe should include it in master and publish a beta version of mockito 3? ||  > instead we maybe should include it in master and publish a beta version of mockito 3?that means stable junit5 support will only be available when mockito 3 final is released i guess this will not happen before q4 2018 an other option is to release junit5 support as seperate mockito 2 addon artefact which requires java 8 like

the build i am all for that :+1: :+1: > what is the benefit for the user here? what do you think of the annotation proposal above? it allows to define strictness at method and nested test levelyes definitely keep them they are very useful to specify exceptions for a single method/nested class however to specify the default strictness on a whole test class i would like to have that incorporated in the `@extendwith` annotation || junit 5 supports meta-annotations so we could provide the following annotation:```java@retention(retentionpolicyruntime)@target({elementtypeannotation_type elementtypetype elementtypemethod})@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)public @interface withmockito {    strictness value() default strictnessstrict_stubs}``` || i am not sure if we should do that  we would have two annotation concepts to define the strictness that is maybe confusing and inconsequent and even conflictingboth annotations  `@strictness` and `@withmockito` are declared with target `elementtypetype` to be applicable to classes in junit5 we have 2 kind of test classes the root-test and nested-test `@withmockito`  will be ignored on nested classes thats fine   `@strictness` can be placed on both but this can lead to conflicts like this:```java@withmockito(warn)@strictness(strict_stubs)class test{   }```----anyway the meta-annotation `@withmockito` is a good idea to avoid boilerplate code ~but i would like to leave out the strictness~ i overlook the `elementtypemethod` in your poposal @tmurakami  now i get your point one can use `@withmockito` to init mocks and define the strictness on a root-test nested and method level this violates the srp  and may lead to problems down the road what do you think? || @christianschwarz could you also add a test for #1163 and verify we can fix that issue? || @christianschwarz sorry i didnt explain it enoughi thought that it would be better to provide an annotation (like @withmockito) that was annotated with `@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)` instead of providing `@strictness`the reason is to reduce boilerplate code as you said> this violates the srp  and may lead to problems down the road what do you think?i was lacking considerationas you say my proposal may violate the sprif mockitoextension supports meta-annotation i suppose that mockito users would be able to create an annotation like `@withmockito` as neededso i think we dont have to provide `@withmockito` || btw junits mockitoextension supports method/constructor injectionhttp://junitorg/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dependency-injectionwhat do you think about supporting it? || > what do you think about supporting it?it was discussed in #445 and definetly worth a look for this pr i would like to provide only a mvp more features should be added in the next steps || > so i think we dont have to provide @withmockitoi like it and keep it for now but without stricness attribute || @timvdlippe @tmurakami do you guys have an idea how to get the build green? i must admit im a gradle noob :fearful: || i think we should disable the

@timvdlippe @mockitoguy what is the current state of the strictness discussion? if you made no decisson yet i would like leave the strictness toppic out of this first pr it can be added later and use `stricnesswarn` as default || @christianschwarz i think our final decision was to remove `@strictness` from test method level but keep it in the extension that leaves strictness on runner mock and soon invocation level for test method level we will need concrete use-cases (see https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1272#issuecomment-361075606) || @timvdlippe okay what you mean by?> remove @strictness from test method level but keep it in the extensionkeep the `@strictness` to be used on top-level-test-class and nested-test-classes? ```java@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)@strictness(warn)public class nestedtests {    @nested    @strictness(silent)    class nestedtest {              }}``` || @christianschwarz on test method level eg```java@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)@strictness(warn) // remove this onepublic class nestedtests {    @nested    @strictness(silent) // remove this one    class nestedtest {                   @strictness(lenient) // remove this one         public void test() {         }    }}``` || @timvdlippe should @extendwith(mockitoextensionclass) be supported on nested-test-classes?```java@extendwith(mockitoextensionlenientclass)public class nestedtests {    @nested    @extendwith(mockitoextensionwarnclass)    class nestedtest {              }}``` || @christianschwarz yes please in this case all invocations in `nestedtest` should have strictness `warn` while all others have `lenient` || i think using subclasses like `mockitoextensionwarn` and `mockitoextensionlenient` is not a good idea because in that case both extensions would get registered and interfere with each other || @marcphilipp hm good point we wanted to keep our api in-line with how we deal with strictness in junit4 do we have any other options to use a similar interface but removing the duplication issue? || confirmed it doesnt work `@stricness`-annotation to the rescue   || that is really unfortunate :cry: will keep on thinking for alternatives but for now we have to resort to `@strictness` || you could handle the duplication issue in the extensions by using lazy initialization and the same namespace to store the `mockitosession` in `extensioncontext` || thank you guys for picking this up!!!lets discuss the strictness annotation (and potentially other settings of the extension) ```@strictness``` annotation looks nice in the test code but it has 2 caveats: - it appears as general purpose api but it is only a setting for junit5 extension this may be confusing for users: annotation used without mockitoextension user thinks it works but it has no effect - it is not easy to discoverwhat do you think about following options: - ```@mockitoextensionsettings(strictnessstrictnesslenient)``` - ```@mockitoextensionsettings(strictnessstrictnesslenient loggermyloggerclass)``` (example future setting) - ```@mockitoextensionstrictness(strictnesslenient)```if we need to discuss the annotation more we can always ship the initial version version of junit5 support without it this way we can unblock a feature for our users while still improve the api incrementally it would be good to make the extension use strict_stubs by default it is consistent with mockitosession and it is inline with our path to stricter stubs by default in future version of mockito	i agree with @timvdlippe that were not ready for strictness per method lets see some solid use cases first to implement it cleanly we should support it for all kinds of runners not only junit5 lets stay focused on junit5 extension and revisit strictness per method later also when we merge #1272 we may not need strictness per method at allwhats the best name of the new module: mockito-junit5 mockito-jupiter? what is the typical naming convention here? || `@mockitoextensionsettings(strictnessstrictnesslenient)` looks modern and more flexible than the junit4 look alike `@extendwith(mockitoextensionlenientclass)` but i would like to shorten it to `@mockitoextension(strictnessstrictnesslenient)`but i wonder how it behave with nested test classes? || @timvdlippe @mockitoguy how should the api finally look like? what should be/ shoud not be included in first version?  || @christianschwarz the first version needs to:1 create mocks with `@mock` and `@spy` and such1 properly handle `mockitosession` even with nested classes1 have strict stub support || how should the extension look?  * `@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)` vs  `@mockitoextension`so we leave the configurable stricness for a next step right? || `@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)` such that users downstream can potentially introduce `@mockitoextension` if they want to that lets us stick to the mainstream junit5 notation with freedom for our users> so we leave the configurable stricness for a next step right?yes please || +1 to @timvdlippes comments@christianschwarz regarding your earlier suggestion with ```@mockitoextension(strictnessstrictnesslenient)```can mockitoextension be at the same time a) annotation for configuring our extension and b) a class referenced in jupiters ```@extendwith```?```@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)@mockitoextension(strictnessstrictnesslenient)class junit5test {}``` || > can mockitoextension be at the same time a) annotation for configuring our extension and b) a class referenced in jupiters `@extendwith`?no that is not possiblean annotation in java is not allowed to implement any interface (other than `annotation`) any attempt to do so will result in a compiler warning similar to the following> annotation type declaration cannot have explicit superinterfaces || you could meta-annotate the annotation with `@extendwith` thoughfor example```java@extendwithmockito(strictnessstrictnesslenient)class junit5test {}``````java@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)@retention(runtime)public @interface extendwithmockito {    strictness strictness() default strictnessstrict}``` || @timvdlippe @mockitoguy i would like to follow the proposal of @marcphilipp but leaving the strictness for now! the stricness can be added later the annotation `@extendwithmockito`  reveal clearly its intention it is even better than `@mockitoextension`  || @christianschwarz yes that seems fine lets try to finish this pr and ship as it has been lingering for quite a while now :smile:  || i am going to polish up this pr this weekend to hopefully get this close to merging it has been waiting for quite a while now :smile:  || all right i have polished up the implementation now (with help from @marcphilipp much appreciated!)the implementation now includes a `@configuredwithmockito` which is an annotation that describes how mockito should run this includes the strictness for now but is extensible to future configuration we would likethere are a couple of action points left:- @mockitoguy could you review this pr in terms of documentation/implementation?- `/gradlew build` does not include the junit5 subproject tests i have no clue why yet :cry: - running the tests directly works in intellij but if i run the module/package instead i get the following stacktrace:```mar 17 2018 3:33:58 pm orgjunitplatformlaunchercoredefaultlauncher handlethrowablewarning: testengine with id

the most consistent and popular naming convention? gradle team calls new junit5 junitplatformthats because the gradle `test` task actually launches the _junit platform_ -- which was released under the """"junit 5"""" umbrella project"""" the """"platform"""" can be used to run test engines for junit jupiter (aka junit 5) junit vintage (aka junit 3 and 4) and any other testing frameworks for which there is a `testengine` (eg spek etc)so the gradle team has made the best choice in calling that support for the junit platform> in this pr were shipping new module orgmockito:junit-jupiter (which i prefer) what is the best name?`junit-jupiter` makes perfect sense here: your extension is an implementation of apis from junit jupiter so you should definitely stick with that!i do the same thing in

and the others for reviewing merging! || "";introduce mockitoextension for junit jupiter (aka junit 5);## new features in junit 5the junit jupiter extension model in junit 5 introduces support for constructor and method parameter resolution (ie dependency injection)specifically third parties can implement the `parameterresolver` extension api to inject dependencies mocks etc into constructors and methods in addition the `testinstancepostprocessor` extension api can be implemented to post-process a test instance (eg to perform field injection)## status quomockito supports _field injection_ for mocks via the `@mock` annotation in addition #438 allows `@mock` to be declared on parameters for constructors and methods which makes `@mock` support an ideal candidate for both the `testinstancepostprocessor` and `parameterresolver` extension apis in junit jupiter in fact the junit team has already developed a proof of concept: see the `mockitoextension` in the [junit5-mockito-extension](https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/tree/master/junit5-mockito-extension) sample project## deliverables- [x] introduce an official `mockitoextension` for junit jupiter to replace the proof of concept from the junit team;""i think this issue can be merged with #390 our plan there was to introduce junit 5 compatibility in mockito 30 (since 20 is on the verge on being released in a couple of weeks) || sorry: i overlooked #390feel free to _merge_ it as you see fitthanks! || lets track the junitextension in this issue and list the specifications of the `mockitoextension` for junit 5 the first point is to improve parameterized compatibility || @sbrannen any news on this ? || @bric3 the `mockitoextension` from the juni"
" team is usable with mockito 20 snapshots and current versions of junit jupiter (junit 5)so its really up to the mockito team to decide when they want to take it over || @sbrannen this one -> [example/mockito/mockitoextension](https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/master/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionjava) ? || yep thats the one || thanks @sbranneni was wondering if any api change would happen on junit 5 we will take over in mockito 3 once we are ready to switch branches for mockito 2 || > i was wondering if any api change would happen on junit 5well thats the million dollar question -- isnt it? ðŸ˜‰ all kidding aside we are currently working on junit jupiter 50 m3 but we still have quite a way to go before a ga release so although i cannot promise that the `extension` apis wont change any before ga it appears that the apis currently implemented by the `mockitoextension` should remain rather stable || ok thats good to know anyway we have to release 21 before starting 30 anyway and a some api design work on 21 too that may delay junit5 integration in the 30 beta phase || shall we start with fleshing out the specifications of the extension? would like to have a working prototype when junit 5 is released eta q1 2017 || yes go for it ill create a submodule junit 5 at this time since junit 5 is a near complete rewrite with a lot of binary incompatibilities || +1do we want to completely decouple mockito-core module from junit? || @szczepiq i am not sure but supporting both `junit4` and `junit5` in `mockito-core` seems problematic we have seen similar issues with `spring` having to support both mockito 1 and 2 therefore i think it is better to refactor mockito 3 such that we publish 2 new artifact: `mockito-junit4` and `mockito-junit5` which provide the integration layer between mockito and junit@sbrannen are you aware of other framework users depending on junit which employ this approach or is there a different and better solution? || in the `spring-test` module for the spring framework we provide support for testng junit 4 and junit jupiter (what you call junit 5) alongside each other just in different packages thats all within a single jar and there are no issues since each of those is an optional dependency (in terms of the maven pom)thus projects that consume `spring-test` can pick which testing framework they wish to use (or potentially use testng junit 4 and junit jupiter all simultaneously  however unlikely that may be)as long as its clear what developers need to consume for a given testing framework it shouldnt be a problem having a single artifact for example with spring junit 4 users use the `springrunner` whereas junit jupiter users use the `springextension` || if you do opt for separate modules (ie maven artifacts) i would recommend against `mockito-junit5` since what you are really providing is an extension for junit jupiter -- which is the new programming model in junit 5the problem with naming such an artifact `mockito-junit5` is that there may well be a junit 6 or 7 still based on the junit jupiter programming and extension models and then the artifact name containing a `5` would no longer make sensefyi: i have just changed the title of this issue to reflect this fact || okay that seems reasonable so lets take the package approach! my experience with jar configurations is limited so in terms of the configuration of users `pomxml` i do not 100% understand how that is going to work but i think we can figure that one out thanks for the explanation @sbrannen ! || @sbrannen thank you for describing and suggesting an approach i like the idea of separation at the java package level in the same jar we can go for separate jars only when we have to (eg when junit versions clash) do you have integration tests that demonstrate correct behavior with different test frameworks / different versions of test frameworks? || > do you have integration tests that demonstrate correct behavior with different test frameworks / different versions of test frameworks?is that a rhetorical question? ðŸ˜‰ yes of course we have tests for the spring framework id be ashamed to let `spring-test` ship without an automated test suiteregarding the package structure if you look [here](https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-test/src/main/java/org/springframework/test/context) youll see the following:- `orgspringframeworktestcontextjunit4`- `orgspringframeworktestcontextjunitjupiter`- `orgspringframeworktestcontexttestng`so thats how we split up the functionality within the `spring-test` jarwe naturally have unit and integration tests for our junit 4 junit jupiter and testng support which you can find in various subpackages [here](https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context)within the ide we execute testng tests with the testng plugin (eg for eclipse) we execute junit 4 tests with the ides built-in support and we execute junit jupiter tests with the `junitplatform` runner (at least within eclipse for the time being) for the latter see [springjunitjupitertestsuite](https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/junit/springjunitjupitertestsuitejava)within the [gradle build](https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/buildgradle#l1123-l1152) we execute testng junit 4 and junit jupiter tests via gradles standard `test` task in other words in order to keep springs build as simple as possible we dont yet use the junit platform gradle plugin to execute junit jupiter tests natively instead we let the gradle `test` task pick up the `springjunitjupitertestsuite` as a junit 4 test (which in turn executes all of our junit jupiter tests as a suite)im not sure if ive now said too much or too little so if you still have questions just ask!regardssam || this week i had an interesting discussion with 2 of my student colleagues who are currently analyzing and documenting the architecture of junit in this discussion we talked about the architecture in general as well as the extensions and in particular the mockitoextensionin this discussion i expressed my concerns regarding the new approach with injecting mocks based on parameters my colleagues told me that junit5 focuses more on testing with interfaces in which the tests are also interfaces since interfaces do not have fields field injection of mocks is not possible therefore the junit team proposes/chose to inject mocks via parametersmaintaining mocks is one of the most precarious tasks when working on a test suite and we at mockito regularly receive feedback where mocks are misbehaving this is the exact reason that we are shipping features such as `strict stubbing` which reduce the amount of confusion and mistakes developers can make by limiting the developer in making mistakes we can prevent tests to incorrectly pass while in fact they are relying on misconfigured mocksas a result our general goal for mockito 3 is to leverage the available tools even more to prevent developers from making mistakes most notably i am personally advocating for increasing type-safety of our various features such that developers can rely on the compiler to warn them since running tests is a costly task and sometimes takes over an hour before ci finished all tests the earlier developers can receive feedback regarding misconfiguration the betterhaving said that lets go back to the parameter injection currently available with junit5 while the status quo is field injection a compiler can warn developers when they have a typo in the usage of a mock eg when a user wants to use `mock1` while the field is actually named `mock2` the compiler errors to notify the developer he/she made a mistake parameter injection does not have this behavior as it is relying merely on the parameter name (or the name supplied to `@mock`) which is plain string comparisonwhile we are striving to prevent developers of making mistakes by leveraging the compiler adopting parameter injection feels like a step back to mefor this reason i am not in favor of going for parameter injection but given the need for writing tests as interfaces i am not sure what our options areof course we have not started writing an extension so i have not tried this out but i do think we should resolve this issue before coming up with a good story for mockito 3 + junit5cc @liamclark @tarovk || how is parameter injection different from field injection?_edit:_ to rephrase my question a bit: how is field injection safer than parameter injection? is there some mockito feature im not aware of? || @marcphilipp i think he was talking about this error case:```javapublic class test {	@mock dependency mock1	@before public void setup() {		when(mock1foo())thenbar()	}	@test public void test() {		// mock2 is a compile error		new sut(mock2)target()	}}``````javaclass test {	@beforeeach void setup(@mock dependency mock1) {		when(mock1foo())thenbar()	}	@test void test(@mock dependency mock2) { // or @mock(name""""mock2"""")		// mock2 is a newly created a mock without foo() stubbing		new sut(mock2)target()	}}```the extension cant know if you intentionally want a new mock in your test method or you made a typo while javac knows that youre referencing a non-existent fieldre edit: the current extension impl caches the mocks: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/026a9d9abe06b6173398c1a2518793259cd190f2/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionjava#l57 || @marcphilipp it is possible i am misunderstanding the proposed solution @twisterrob beat me to it with an example testcase which i was indeed referring to || thanks for the explanation and the example that helped! ðŸ™‚with strict stubbing the example in the error case would throw a """"validation error"""" in the end right?since we cannot force people to compile with `-parameters` i think there are at least these possible approaches:1 treat every mock parameter like a different mock unless it has an explicit name2 treat mock parameters for the same type like theyre the refer to the same mock unless they have different explicit names3 dont support injecting mocks into methods besides test methods at allwhat i like about being able to use method parameters: the mock is local to one test method you can use different or even no mocks in different test methods || > with strict stubbing the example in the error case would throw a """"validation error"""" in the end right?yes but at run-time instead of at compile-time nonetheless better then nothing :stuck_out_tongue: > what i like about being able to use method parameters: the mock is local to one test method you can use different or even no mocks in different test methodsi do understand the reasoning but if you need a mock that is local to a test method why not a simple `mock mock  mock(mockclass)` at the start of the method? this usually also nicely fits in a `given-when-then` structure of test methodsjust to note: i would really like to take advantage of parameter mocking but thus far i am afraid of creating more problems and confusion than it actually solves maybe we can come up with a golden solution :smile:  || no worries i hear you and understand your concerns we should definitely try to find the best solution ðŸ™‚ || +1 for locality and treating every mock parameter like a different mock unless it has an explicit nameit also discourages complex mocking in interface tests || +1 agree with locality common setup in `@before` usually creates more problems than solves || for locality developers can already call `mock()` themselves however @liamclark pointed out during a chat that `@mock` on a parameter can safely handle generics for example when mocking streams that seems like a valid usecase if we can solve this issue without ambiguity between multiple mocks that could work || also `@mock` feels a bit more declarative then mock(classliteralclass) || @liamclark not to mention all parameters that annotation can have versus the equivalent `mocksettings` builder || junit5 has been released and as such we probably need to create an official extension hopefully i have time in the near future but feel free to contribute a pr if you have time || what are the requirements for a mvp? || on the top of my head runner-like functionality with:1 initialize `@mock` and `@injectmocks`1 check verificationstate after test ran1 clean up mockitoframework listeners1 check for strict stubs || okay i am looking into it* should it target mockito 2? * is a new subproject required? || yes to both! || what should go into the junit5-subproject? the implementation the junit5 tests or both ?  || the implementation of a mockito extension for junit5 it is probably coming down to a single or a couple of classes || any news on this issue? || @marcphilipp development started in #1221 there we hit #1232 which is an internal issue there are several implicit assumptions in our internal api that were true for junit4 but are no longer valid for junit5 if i understand the issue correctly the current extension has to supported nested classes with junit4 we did not support this but with junit5 we have to do thistimeline-wise i am not sure how much time one of the @mockito/core developers has to review #1221 and fix our internal api especially as `mockitosession` is part of our public api we have little wiggle room i know that the software quality and testing course in quarter 4 of our university wants to use mockito and junit5 so i probably need to discuss with @liamclark what the details of that is i might be able to find some time in that regard to work on this issueall in all while implementation seemed easy at first we hit some unfortunate core issues in our public api that need to be addressed once we figured that out it should be fairly straightforward to finish the extension || thanks for the update! let me know if i can help in any way ðŸ™‚  || thank @marcphilipp for a friendly ping and @timvdlippe for recapping the statusim making progress on getting strictness configurable: #792 this should remove a complexity from the junit5 extension pr that @christianschwarz was working on i hope that christian can resume work if not we can review the design and someone will take a stab at it how about you @marcphilipp? || i can resume to work on it  actually i am short on time so a """"pre""""-review of  #1221 would help maybe some one can start with #1232 in the mean time || regarding #1232: another option would be to not support nesting of test classes i think we actively have to consider this option given our public api was apparently coupled to the junit4 implementation and we can not ship breaking changes per our policy || well its `@incubating` so you could still change it right? ðŸ˜‰besides i think neither of the two proposals would break compatibility would they? but then again we should discuss this over at #1232 ðŸ™‚  || hm looking at it again it seems that the breaking change is actually in an internal api namely [`testfinishedevent`](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/junit/testfinishedeventjava#l11) which is created in `mockitosession` as such i think we should be okay actually i will do a proper investigation this weekend (hopefully else next week) and update #1221 i hope you are okay with that @christianschwarz ? once that is done i can more definitively say the impact on our api and whether we are risking a breaking change i have good hopes now we might actually dodge that || `testfinishedeventgettestclassinstance()` and `testfinishedeventgettestmethodname()` are currently only used (twice) like this:```javastring testname  eventgettestclassinstance()getclass()getsimplename()                   + """""""" + eventgettestmethodname()```currently `defaultmockitosession` always uses `null` for `testfinishedeventgettestmethodname()` which strikes me as odd i think it would be better if `testfinishedevent` only had two methods: `getfailure()` and `gettestname()` then `mockitosessionbuilder` could get a `testname(string)` builder method and `defaultmockitosessionbuilder` could pass it to `defaultmockitosession` and so onalternatively `mockitosessionbuilder` could get a `testmethodname()` builder method and pass that onmoreover i think `mockitosessionbuilder` should allow to configure a `mockitologger` this way frameworks like junit could pass in a custom implementation for junit jupiter a `mockitologger` that publishes report entries instead of writing to stdout (which causes problems will parallel execution) comes to mindthoughts? || @marcphilipp @timvdlippe good idea to continue the discussion about #1232 in that ticket i copied your the relevant comments over there || it would be nice if the mockitoextension works together with `@testfactory` based methods when i use the extension created by the junit team i need to manually reset mocks within the dynamic test method @sbrannen you guys already thought about how to integrate that? || @paulmiddelkoop theres no lifecycle support for dynamic tests and we currently have no plans to add any ie theres no hook to reset mocks after a dynamic test you could use `mockitosession` in your `@testfactory` method directly ðŸ¤” || i agree with @marcphilipp: due to the lack of lifecycle support for dynamic tests (see the [dynamic test lifecycle](https://junitorg/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dynamic-tests) _note_ in the user guide) youll have to reset mocks manuallynote however that youll likely want to reset them within each `executable` (ie lambda expression or method reference) returned by your `@testfactory` method || thanks @marcphilipp and @sbrannen for the explanation any reason why there is no lifecycle support for dynamic tests? for now i ended up with a utility function for this:```kotlin    fun dynamicmockitotest(testinstance: any displayname: string executable: () -> unit): dynamictest {        val mockito  mockitomockitosession()            initmocks(testinstance)            strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)            startmocking()        try {            return dynamictest(displayname executable)        } finally {            mockitofinishmocking()        }    }```however this will not work if i also have regular `@test` methods and implement the mockitoextension to also use the mockitosession instead of `mockitoannotationsinitmocks(testinstance)` it will result in a """"previous mockitosession was not concluded with finishmocking()"""" error which is logical i could put the `extendwith(mockitoextension::class)` on every `@test` method instead of the class as a solution i guess i think a simpler integration is needed for a good adoption of dynamic tests its a regular use case to use mocking inside dynamic tests right? || > any reason why there is no lifecycle support for dynamic tests?dynamic tests are intended for simple use cases that do not need lifecycle callback support if one needs lifecycle callback support it is then recommended to use parameterized tests> however this will not work if i also have regular `@test` methodsactually that wont work at all not even for dynamic testsyour current code example initializes and resets mocks around the _construction_ of the `dynamictest` instance whereas it must do that at _execution_ time (ie when the `executable` is actually invoked by junit jupiter)you would instead need to create your own _wrapper_ around the invocation of your `executable` and that wrapper would need to implement the try-finally logic around the execution of the actual `executable`> i think a simpler integration is needed for a good adoption of dynamic tests its a regular use case to use mocking inside dynamic tests right?we dont know the dynamic test support is an _experimental_ feature so that remains to be seen ðŸ˜‰  || @paulmiddelkoop if you create an extension method you dont need to pass in `this@footest` every time:```kotlinfun anydynamicmockitotest(displayname: string executable: () -> unit): dynamictest 	dynamictest(displayname) {		val mockito  mockitomockitosession()				initmocks(this@dynamicmockitotest)				strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)				startmocking()		try {			executable()		} finally {			mockitofinishmocking()		}	}```and the usages of `dynamictest` and `dynamicmockitotest` should look the same (this version also includes what @sbrannen said to delay the try-finally execution)> so that remains to be seenwell now you have two votes for mocking in dynamic tests || @paulmiddelkoop & @twisterrob if you want support for lifecycle callbacks for dynamic tests in junit jupiter the best place to make your wishes heard is https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/378 || what is the eta for mockito 3x? id love to see this feature || the intent now is to ship junit5 support in a separate artifact with mockito 2 || @timvdlippe that is great news - maybe the milestone should be updated to reflect this?for any others waiting for this https://githubcom/jeffreyfalgout/junit5-extensions/tree/master/mockito-extension might be of help in the meantime  || a little house-keeping:the change in #438 was made to allow mocks to be generated for the parameters to test and support methods || @smoyer64 that is correct i wanted to publish the extension as it was lingering for too long and thus did not want to wait on discussion about """"new features"""" (compared to the 4 runner) please open a new issue to discuss that change || @timvdlippe i havent had a chance to try out the official ``mockitoextension`` you published yesterday (im watching for it in maven central but rereading your post perhaps i should be watching sonatypes oss-snapshots) so i wasnt aware that the version you published was missing this functionality  i just thought it was important to lump these two requests togetherthe ``mockitoextension`` prototype that published as a sample by the junit 5 team has this feature so i guessed i assumed the official version did too?  in any case i think its a really useful feature for cases where not every test needs a specific ``mock`` (and the injected ``mock`` has different behaviors if used in more than one test) so id be happy to write up a feature requesti have to admit i was pretty excited to see this released yesterday since it would provide an official way to use mockito with junit 5  unfortunately were already using the ``parameterresolver`` from the prototype ``mockitoextension`` so i guess were in for a bit more of a wait  let me know if i can help || @smoyer64 as i said i am open for adding that feature but i would like to discuss it first in a separate issue so please open one with your use-case so we can discuss ðŸ˜„  || @timvdlippe sorry i wasnt clear in my last comment  i do realize that this issue is closed and went off to write the feature request you asked for (and got side-tracked by an emergency with one of the non-profits i help run)  i also looked at all the junit 5 related issues that were already posted  would it be worth having a junit 5 label to help organize them?in any case ive now added #1348  please let me know if additional information is neededthanks for all the hard work youve done to provide official junit 5 support in mockito! || since this is one of the top google results for trying to get this working and ill likely google it again id like to add that this is in the mockito-junit-jupiter project [maven central link mockito-junit-jupiter](https://mvnrepositorycom/artifact/orgmockito/mockito-junit-jupiter) || "";1;0;process @mockitoguy feedback;"

docs](https://docscodecovio/docs/pull-request-comments) || @raphw to help us mockito-users it would be useful to have a short wiki entry describing purpose/use-case of the flag """"orgmockitolocksingleton"""" || added a segment to the documentation || is it possible to test these changes now ? from -snapshot build for exampleive just hit this issue with sbt+mockito 2120 and id be glad to give feedback! || you should be able to clone this repository check out this branch and then `/gradlew build` the artifact which you can include in your project || ive thought about this but it is not that easy with different build tools :-)let me see whether there is something like `gradlelocal()` in sbt || good news - it works!bad news - it slows down the build!i used `/gradlew install && cp build/libs/mockito-core-2121jar /home/martin/ivy2/cache/orgmockito/mockito-core/jars/mockito-core-2120jar` and then `sbt -dorgmockitolocksingletontrue` now my build and tests pass!in my `master` branch where it uses mockito 1x the build+tests pass for 45secs in the branch with mockito 2121 + `-dorgmockitolocksingletontrue` it takes 55 secsim following https://githubcom/sbt/sbt/issues/3022 so hopefully soon ill get rid of `-dorgmockitolocksingletontrue` || >good news - it works!awesome! :)>bad news - it slows down the build!using the property or not should not affect the performance if you look at the code change regardless if we use """"classloader"""" or """"bootstrap_lock"""" as lock monitor we should have the same performance characteristic either of those objects is a singleton in the jvm that runs testsi suspect that your tests are slower because mockito 2x is a bit slower that 1x in general this could be because we fixed bunch of concurrency issues and added safeguards we can always try to optimize mockito - contributions are welcome :) || > using the property or not should not affect the performancehere is my setup:1) mockito 2120 + `parallelexecution in test : false` in buildsbt > 45 secs2) mockito 2121 (built from this branch) + `// parallelexecution in test : false` > 55 secsso it is not mockito 1x vs 2x but just this new lock + parallel tests3) mockito 11018 + `parallelexecution in test : true` (this is the default in sbt) > 42 secsmy team voted to go back to mockito 1x until the issue in sbt is fixed :-/  although setup 1) is not bad! || hi @mockitoguy i see your argument it is not a good default to rely on a user setting when class loading hierarchies can cause deadlocks in the first place maybe it should be the other way round? would you rather configure it using the runner in this case?and yes byte buddy is a bit slower on class creation then cglib this is due to its proper resolution of generic types and visibility bridges etc and because of its retention of meta data like annotations this is extra work that cglib never did but it helped us to solve a bunch of bugs for this reason the benchmarks are difficult to compare || > my team voted to go back to mockito 1x until the issue in sbt is fixed :-/ although setup 1) is not bad!@martin-g when the issue with sbt is fixed we suspect that you will still have the perf degradation when moving to mockito 2x (trying to manage your expectations) || >it is not a good default to rely on a user setting when class loading hierarchies can cause deadlocks in the first place maybe it should be the other way round? would you rather configure it using the runner in this case?hey @raphw! the idea with the runner is interesting! it is better because it does not introduce yet another way to configure mockito it still is not discoverable well and the user will get deadlock in the first place :)why not using bootstrap_lock always? i pushed the commit to your branch to illustrate the idea || any news on this? || @raphw @mockitoguy news ? ðŸ˜„  || @elfolink thank you for pushing!@raphw are you ok with simplifying locking (my last commit)? id like to merge this pr in its current form || yes looks like an easy-enough solution and the performance hit does not seem too severe go for it! || "";partial;""hi heres the implementation of the partial mock support i was talking about:```partialmock(class)partialmock(object enclosinginstance class innerclass)```the second overload is the one solution to the arbitrary constructor parameter issue:```@mock private collaborator1 mockcollaborator1@mock private collaborator2 mockcollaborator2@partialmock private mockworker workerabstract class mockworker extends worker {  mockworker() {    super(mockcollaborator1 mockcollaborator2)  }}```i didnt name it spy() for the following reasons:1 spy() doesnt work for final methods it would be surprising if users partial mock works without """"final"""" and stops working when """"final"""" is added the non-abstract methods arent meant to be mocked after all2 with partial mock one goal is to allow having state in the object the shallow copying of spy() wont always work when there is mutable state especially if there are private methods in the class that spy cannot intercept3 """"spy"""" conceptually needs a target object to spy on without a target spy(fooclass) feels non-intuitive4 all the use cases i know of for partial mocking dont need spying5 if really needed one can always explicitly `spy(partialmock(fooclass))`annotation support isnt added yet"";""another use case i considered but would like to get some feedback before adding to the javadocas the faq puts it:> technically speaking mockito is a test spy framework> test spy framework allows to verify behaviour (like mocks) and stub methods (like good old hand-crafted stubs)but it leaves one question open: should one ever use the """"good old hand-crafted stubs"""" at all? if yes under what scenario?a main reason that people use the `when()thenreturn()` dsl instead of the hand-crafted stubs is that for interfaces with many methods hand-crafting the stub means to write lots of extra boilerplate override methods that arent interesting to the testbut with partial mock the above is no longer true its easy enough to hand-roll an abstract stub class implementing only the interesting methods and then partialmock() itbetween the two different ways of stubbing (plain old `@override` vs `when()thenreturn()`) heres a guideline ive been following with success:- `when()thenreturn()` is best used to stub data logically related to the current test that is its best used in the individual test methods the dsl reads nicely in the bdd given-when-then style- for stubbing shared data that arent logically specific to any individual test plain old abstract classes work better because the `when()thenreturn()` dsl can usually lead to messy setup() method with stubbing of several different objects crammed together in other words prefer `partialmock(stubfooclass)` over `when()thenreturn()` statements in setup() || heythanks so much for taking the time to implement this heres some feedback about your design decisions:1 i respect the arguments for avoiding reusing spy nomenclature for good or bad mockito spies are called partial mocks this pattern is also used in other mocking libraries like spock imho adding a separate method may confuse users2 i think that the message that hand stubs are recommended for stubbing that typically ends up in setup() method is a bit too strong from my experience rolling out hand stubs typically indicates design smell - theres too much ask style interactions and too little tell style interactions the latter better isolate responsibilities leading to cleaner designnow lets look into the code :) || oh right i reviewed the codes :)one thing that stands out is that partial mock seems to be driving the api and the implementation towards a new kind of mock ideally we would like to avoid it in mockito were trying to generalize more and avoid creation of new kinds of mocksto accept the pr we would like to simplify the api and implementation api:1 mockitospy(fooclass object  constructorargs)2 withsettings()constructorargs(object  args)3 withsettings()outerinstance(object object)1) delegates to: mock(fooclass withsettings()constructorargs(object  constructorargs)defaultanswer(calls_real_methods)also this should work with regular mocks too eg if someone specifies the constructorargs (we can call it differently eg usesconstructor etc) then the instance is created via the constructor instead of by using the objenesisthis can be implemented incrementally for example:1 add constructorargs/usesconstructor support2 add outerinstance/enclosinginstance support3 add spy methodthis is great stuff thanks for this pr sorry i cannot merge it in this form just yet perhaps ill add some code to get this started || thanks for spending the time reviewing this code!i was thinking that i cannot make spy work while also keeping final methods in fakes workbut reading your reply a few times convinced me that i misunderstood how spies work and its actually pretty trivial to implement so in short i was wrong `spy(class)` tastes sweet!what do you think of the new revision?- mockitospy(fooclass object  constructorargs)again i dont feel we need to support arbitrary constructor args its not statically type safe or refactoring friendly there are ambiguity issues wrt constructor overloads  and lastly while 0-constructor-arg abstract classes without state can be fine (like abstractlist) abstract classes with state feels more often a design smell- withsettings()outerinstance(object object)hmm kinda feel that the api of `spy(outer innerclassclass)` reads more intuitive: the outer object is the qualifier for the inner class just as how we say `outernew innerclass()`also unlike other mock settings that apply to every method that accepts it outerinstance() is only meaningful to `spy() mock(fooclass settingsouterinstance(outer))` would be meaningless || on my radar ill reply tomorrow )on sat oct 18 2014 at 1:31 am

type safe or refactoring friendly there are ambiguity issues wrt constructor overloads  and lastly while 0-constructor-arg abstract classes without state can be fine (like abstractlist) abstract classes with state feels more often a design smelli agree with everything you wrote thing is we cannot really objectively say that stateful abstract classes are ok only when have 0-arg constructor consequently we cannot restrict the api based on this assumption users will come up with use case for argumented abstract classes and it will be hard to defend it also mockito needs to balance out the toolkit approach (unopinionated) with framework approach (opinionated) to describe this further: from the standpoint of api design we _can_ declare that in our opinion mocking abstract classes is a design smell and we dont want to support it officially (we could however open some extension points for users to implement it unofficially) but we cannot really say that _some_ abstract classes are ok to mock and some not at least this is my view on the subject and i respect if you have a different povimho we dont have to provide constructor args in the first iteration but we should plan for it api-wise so that adding this feature later does not incur any deprecation or api awkwardness we should also avoid documenting that we are not planning to do the constructor args because we believe it is a smell however we can document that _typically_ mocking abstract classes hints at design smell etc> hmm kinda feel that the api of spy(outer innerclassclass) reads more intuitivespy() method and the withsettings() method are not """"alternative"""" implementations :) all spy() methods need to delegate to a mock() method that has specific spy-related withsettings() other words: every possible kind of mock can be created using this entry point of the api: http://mockitogithubio/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/mockitohtml#mock(javalangclass%20orgmockitomocksettings) think about the spy() method (and overloaded mock() methods) as a convenience methods / syntax sugar over the main mock creation entry point> spy(outer innerclassclass)id rather avoid overloaded spy() method that uses outer instance initially it feels that mocking inner abstract classes is somewhat an edge case (arguably) we could provide an api for this via withsettings() though from my objective standpoint it feels that its more important to support constructor arguments than to support mocking inner classes (eg i would dare to say that there are more use cases that support the former feature)i havent yet looked in the code :) || i reviewed the code please dont get disheartened by the amount of review items :) im enjoying this conversation immensely and im really happy that you will contribute it! it will be a great feature in mockitoive done some refactorings in mockito regarding mock initialization and i will push it now merging your stuff will be hard and im sorry for this i hope that the code after the refactorings will be easier for you to implement the feature ) || pushed take a look at orgmockitointernalcreationcglibclassimposterizertest#shouldcreateclassbyconstructor || thanks for explaining the rationale so clearly and patiently! some further clarifications below in hope that i could sell the idea better :)ill work on the refactoring and merging later> thing is we cannot

povagreed the """"opinion"""" is but one reason though another one is that its not type safe and would pose a difficulty to tools like ide later when someone is trying to find references to a constructorwhile mockito doesnt need to be an opinionated framework i think its fair to say that mockito can choose to only implement a feature that it does better than alternativesi imagine if someday someone wants to spy a class with constructor args my suggestion would be to create a simple subclass wrapper:```@mock private collaborator collaborator@spy private mockfoo fooabstract class mockfoo extends abstractfoo {  mockfoo() {    super(collaborator blah)  }}```this way everything is still nicely compiler and tool friendly one major difference between mockito/easymock and jmock (at least the earlier versions) is that they are type safe supporting arbitrary constructor args using object[] takes a step away from the type safetythere may still be the 20% use case where the constructor args have to be provided dynamically so the inner class approach wont work i wasnt sure if mockito should charge itself to support this kind of rare edge cases starting from a minimalist perspective i went with """"when in doubt leave it out""""im certainly biased if that doesnt make the case i respect your decision :)> id rather avoid overloaded spy() method that uses outer instance initially it feels that mocking inner abstract classes is somewhat an edge case (arguably) we could provide an api for this via withsettings() though from my objective standpoint it feels that its more important to support constructor arguments than to support mocking inner classes (eg i would dare to say that there are more use cases that support the former feature)regarding the pros/cons between constructor-args vs inner class my view is quite different i see """"constructor-args"""" as a crude half-baked product that no one except perhaps framework builders should ever use there are even ambiguity problems we have to solve what do we do for the following case?```abstract class withparams {  withparams(comparable runnable) {}  withparams(serializable enum) {}}comparable comparable  enum1runnable runnable  enumthatimplementsrunnablespy(withparamsclass comparable runnable)```and what about generics?```abstract class withparams {  withparams(set<string>) {}  withparams(iterable<foo>) {}}spy(withparamsclass fooset)```thanks to erasure mockito will have no way to figure out that foosets static type is `set<foo>` so itll still be puzzled even though from users perspective there is no ambiguity whatsoeverin both cases the problem is that mockito has no access to the declared """"static"""" type that the compiler uses and users typically think in terms of mockito has access to the runtime types which if relied upon can sometimes cause surprising behavioron the other hand inner class is type safe tool friendly no surprise constructor-args isntwe can use inner class to solve most use cases that seemingly need constructor-argsperhaps we can study a few use cases and see how the two contemplated apis each pans out?re: withsettings(): i respect your preference for what the api looks like so ill just make sure my concerns are heardi have no concern passing these extra state through the settings object internally the concern is with the overly wide api surface added if we allow users to do:```spy(anobject withsettings()withenclosinginstance(instance))```or```mock(fooclass withsettings()withenclosinginstance())```none of the above make logical sense so could turn out to be surprising to some users if enclosinginstance is only logical to the spy(class) method alone do we want to make it possible to (mis)use to all the other api methods when users hit autocomplete?also consider this a slippery slope argument if the other mock/fake methods later gain their own extra parameters that only make sense to individual api methods (as opposed to the cross-cutting settings today in mocksettings) do we cram them all into the mocksettings object so that users would have to bookmark in their mind things like: """"setting 1 should only be used for api 1 and api 2 but not api 3 or api4 setting 2 is good for api 2 only setting 3 is for api 2 and api 5""""its contrived but i feel by adding enclosinginstance to mocksettings its the first step toward that direction || i fear my long reply did a poor job advertising the inner class support let me try in a mock faq style#### why do i ever want to test a non-static inner class? isnt it an implementation detail?no you dontthe inner class support isnt really for _testing_ your production inner classes rather the idea is to reduce most abstract classes with constructor parameters to an inner class **enclosed by the test**lets look at an example how do you test the following class?```abstract class myabstractclass {  myabstractclass(collaborator collaborator) {}  abstract void dosomething()}```the constructor has a parameter which is a collaborator you can `spy` it by creating an inner class in the test as such:```public class myabstractclasstest {  @mock private collaborator mockcollaborator  @spy private mockabstractclass foo  public void test1() {        verify(foo)dosomething()  }  abstract class mockabstractclass extends myabstractclass {    mockabstractclass() {      super(mockcollaborator)    }  }}```#### why inner class? why not just pass the constructor arguments directly?a few problems with that approach:1 its not statically type safe we could have provided `spy(class object constructorargs)` but then you lose static type checking and when someone tries to figure out """"who are the callers?"""" the spy() call evades that kind of static analysis and makes it harder to understand the bigger picture of the code2 overload ambiguities make it difficult to implement in a least astonishment way consider the following class:```abstract class myabstractclass {  myabstractclass(iterable<user> users)  myabstractclass(set<string> userids)}```the following `spy` call would be ambiguous:```set<user> users  myabstractclass my  spy(myabstractclassclass users)```while both you and compiler know for sure `users` is a set of user thanks to type erasure mockito only knows `usersgetclass()` which is set is it an `iterable<string>` or `set<user>`? no ideaand thats just one parameter#### sure but you can throw an exception in case of ambiguity im not sure how often people create potentially ambiguous overloadsit can happen in practice that at day 1 there is only one constructor and then later on more are added despite the best practice of avoiding potentially ambiguous overloads it occasionally happens some even for good reasons for example:```mything(iterable<user> whensizeisunknown) {}mything(collection<user> whensizeisknown) {}```seems harmless right?so overall we figured that its better (and easy enough with inner class) for the programmer to explicitly tell us which constructor to use and which parameters and types to pass to it than mockito making _mostly-right-but-sometimes-surprising_ guesseslike:```public class thetest {  private set<user> users  @spy mockclass sut    abstract class mockclass extends myabstractclass {    mockclass() {      super(users)  // no amgibuity    }  }}``` || heyi admire your energy in selling the idea :) more feedback:- majority of users (that ive seen) take advantage of @injectmocks which already removes the type safety regarding the constructors- we already have to deal with constructor selection for the @injectmocks- personally i find the choice between statically typed inner abstract classes vs duck-typed constructor parameters the matter of taste myself i would choose test clarity and reduced boilerplate over better refactoring/searchability support for constructors- i like this little pattern of yours i think it is cool yet im not prepared to shape mockito api to force this pattern it seems too opinionated id rather give choice and have mockito support both approacheswe dont have to support constructor args we can wait for community feedback perhaps nobody asks for it and everybody is happy :)lets conclude on the api:```spy(fooclass)mock(fooclass withsettings()innerof(someobject)usingconstructor())//options: """"enclosinginstance"""" """"constructor"""" """"constructorargs""""```makes sense? :) || > we already have to deal with constructor selection for the @injectmocksits not very comparable right? in `@injectmocks` all the static types of the fields and the constructor signature are available to mockito if the constructors signature is `foo(set<user>)` mockito has full information of the signature so there isnt any ambiguity problemwhen we do support duck typing my suggestion would be something similar to easymocks constructorargs (http://easymockorg/api/org/easymock/constructorargshtml) which explicitly passes in the constructor object to avoid constructor selection problem its not as handy yes but as you said most users use `@injectmocks` or `@spy` anywaybut yes lets leave constructor-args for future iterationsfor now the remaining gaps between use cases im having in mind and the suggested syntax:1 what if foos constructor is private and cglib cannot call it? my current implementation skips calling such constructor as a way for users to suppress constructor when it does undesirable things but if it does skip `useconstructor()` would seem imprecise `usenonprivateconstructor()`? a bit mouthful no?2 in the current implementation `spy(classwithparameteredconstructorclass)` skips constructor should it throw exception instead?3 in the current implementation spy(innerclassclass) throws exception are you okay with that?thanks! || okay i merged with upstream i believe ive also implemented the suggested

constructorthere is a use case we are missing if we throw on private constructor: sometimes you may want to fake a class that didnt expose its constructor by exposing a static factory instead or if the constructor does bad things (like connect to database)if we throw on private constructor there would be absolutely no way to fake it unless we create another way for user to say """"fake it but dont call constructor""""its weird if the user called `useconstructor()` yet it ends up not using constructor but if user only called `spy(fooclass)` i think its not weird if we skip private constructorwhat do you think of `useconstructorifpossible()`? || sorry i hadnt realize travis wasnt happy with the broken javadoc linkfixed nowlet me know what you think of the current designthanks!

me know if you want to improve it one way or another :) || awesome! thanksdo you like me to add the `@spy abstractclass` support or youll just do it? || do you mean changing the @spy annotation so that it out-of-the box works with abstractclasses? for sure :) lets do separate pr/ticket for itbtw id like to mention you in the release notes by name can you reveal yourself (or configure your github account :) || hi thanks for taking over and cleaning it up!i have a question about the current implementationif im reading the code correctly `spy(abstractclassclass)` can construct an instance using the proxy classs constructorbut it should have mocked the abstract methods rather than call_real_method on themthe following test shows what i expect to happen but fails in the current master branch:```    static abstract class abstractthing {        abstract string message()        string fullmessage() {            return """"hi """" + message()        }    }    @test    public void abstract_method() {        abstractthing thing  mockitospy(abstractthingclass)        assertequals(""""hi null"""" thingfullmessage())    }```in summary abstract methods by default should use the standard mockito stubbing only the real non-abstract methods are by default invoked the partialmockanswer class in this pr was supposed to implement this logic || good point! i missed that ) do you want to fix it in a separate pr? || i have a design question to run by you before creating the prdo you think it makes sense to change calls_real_method directly? it seems useless for it to call abstract methods only to throw an abstractmethoderrorso perhaps calls_real_method can be made a bit smarter to delegate to returns_defaults when it knows its pointless to call abstract method?i guess then spy() doesnt need to change || i think this is a good idea! im curious whats the current behavior when calls_real_method is used for abstract method? whats the behavior when someone tries to mock an interface and sets the default answer to be calls_real_method?thanks for your insights! || heres the error i just got from using calls_real_method on interface methods:```orgmockitoexceptionsbasemockitoexception: cannot call abstract real method on java object!calling real methods is only possible when mocking non abstract method  //correct example:  when(mockofconcreteclassnonabstractmethod())thencallrealmethod()``` || cool we can make calls_real_method smarter i think lets also update itsdocumentationthanks a lot for your help!!!!on sat nov 22

why 2 new public methods? sometimes common stubbing has a form of one or few stubbings in """"before"""" method - its best to configure leniency per stubbing sometimes a mock object has many common stubbings (described in detail in the ticket thread below) - its best to configure leniency per mock## examples1 common stubbing```javapublic mockitorule rule  mockitojunitrule()strictness(strictnessstrict_stubs)@mock(lenient  true) foo mock@before public void before() {  //a) common stubbing needed for most test methods  when(mockfoo())thenreturn(""""bar"""")  }```2 api caveats:```java@test public void demo() {  //b) not possible to stub the same method using when with different args:  lenient()when(mockfoo(1))thenreturn(1)  when(mockfoo(2))thenreturn(2) // <- works!  //c) code under test cannot use stubbed call with different argument (sometimes we need it)  lenient()when(mockfoo(1))thenreturn(1)  mockfoo(2) // <- works!}```## original reportthe new unnecessarystubbingexception logic is great however it is sometimes useful to disable this detection for specific methods could it be possible to add an annotation that says """"unnecessary stubs should not be detected in this method""""?this would also make it easier to migrate from mockito 1* to mockito 2 this is the case in the project i am currently working at where we have created some utility methods that creates a mock and configures it to fit most of our use cases as we use this method at many places where different configuration is needed it will cause a lot of unnecessary stubbing thus we would like to keep this method out of unneccessary stubbing-check while doing this check on the rest of the code base"";""thank you very much for this feedback!do you use the silent junit runner currently to avoid the exception in your scenario?your feedback and recent code review from @bric3 made me think about enabling/disabling stubbing strictness per method or per class using annotations for example (brainstorming):```java@mockito(strictstubs  true)public class sometest {  @test  @mockito(strictstubs  false)  public void sometestmethod() {  }}``` || thanks for following up on this!yes we currently use the silent runner which works fine but of course lacks the stubbing checking that we would like to have on the rest of the methodsannotations for this sounds to me like a good solution to the problem it would be really great if this annotation could also be used on helper methods such as in our scenario:```@mockito(strictstubs  true)public class sometest {@testpublic void sometestmethod() {    code code  createcode(""""a"""")}@mockito(strictstubsfalse) private code createcode(string codetype) {    code code  mock(codeclass)    doreturn(codetype)when(code)getcodetype() // not always but in most cases invoked }}``` || thanks for the suggestions! my feedback / questions:1 is there a reason why you use the runner and not mockito junit rule?2 the annotation api would not work on the helper methods only on the test methods its because the rule only captures and provides the test method to the implementation || thanks for your feedback!1 no not really we have not really looked at the difference nor taken a conscious choice on this2 oh i see that means that it would be hard to use annotations to do this the way i was hoping was possible ideally it would be great if we could enable unnecessary stubbing in general but configure it so a developer could call the createcode method without having to mind the unnecessary stubbing here or perhaps by setting some properties on the junitrunner? so that createcode could be something like    ```java    private code createcode(string codetype) {       junitrunnerdisable_stubbing_check()       code code  mock(codeclass)       doreturn(codetype)when(code)getcodetype() // not always but in most cases invoked       junitrunnerenable_stubbing_check()    }    ```i am not that into the mockito codebase but i would guess that this could require quite some rewrite? (and it also indicates that our usage of helper methods are probably not a smart path to follow) || my point on helper method or helper object for mocks is usually that the model shows mock anti pattern or that the granularity of the test is not narrow enough usually that means that a concrete object should be **built** instead not a mockthe idea may be intersting though probably not in mockito 2 in mockito 3 (jdk8) maybe we could introduce apis like this :```javamockitoruleinconfiguration()                     strictness(strictnesslenient)                     stub(() -> {                            doreturn(codetype)when(code)getcodetype() // possible stub                           //                      })```_the above snippet is mostly exploring idea for this kind of api as i dont have these kind of needs at this time it may be just wrong in many aspects_ || see #840 - i created a proposal for solving this use case for junit rules || as an alternative solution could you use the mocksettings? eg something like ```code code  mock(codeclass withsettings()nounnecssarystubbing())``` || i also found a use case:im mocking zk which uses a lot of map-like structures which are exposed via accessors (`getattributes()` `getattribute(string)` `getattribute(string boolean)` `setattribute()` )in my test setup i create a map and im using `thenanswer()` and `doanswer()` to link the accessor methods to my test map the code then looks like this:```    private map<string object> desktopattributes  new linkedhashmap<>()            desktopattributesput(attr_event_queues desktopeventqueues)            mockdesktop desktop  mock(mockdesktopclass)            when(desktopgetattributes())thenreturn(desktopattributes)            when(desktopgetattribute(argumentmatchersanystring()))            thenanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                object value  desktopattributesget(name)                return value            })            when(desktopgetattribute(argumentmatchersanystring() mockitoanyboolean()))            thenanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                object value  desktopattributesget(name)                return value            })            doanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                object value  answergetargument(1)                desktopattributesput(name value)                return null            })when(desktop)setattribute(mockitoanystring() mockitoany())            doanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                object value  answergetargument(1)                desktopattributesput(name value)                return null            })when(desktop)setattribute(mockitoanystring() mockitoany() mockitoanyboolean())            when(desktophasattribute(mockitoanystring()))            thenanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                return desktopattributescontainskey(name)            })            when(desktophasattribute(mockitoanystring() mockitoanyboolean()))            thenanswer(answer -> {                string name  answergetargument(0)                return desktopattributescontainskey(name)            })```i need this code block three times (desktop attribute map session attributes servlet context attributes) i prefer mocking over mock objects since the interfaces have hundreds of methodsi have put this code into a shared junit rule its lazy but its also generic: since the rule doesnt know what parts of zk the test will call it cant tell which accessor methods will be needed but i still need to know when a method is called which wasnt mockedtherefore i need a way to tell mockito """"there might be unused stubs in the following code block but thats ok since its shared by many tests"""" an annotation on the test wont work since the code is in a junit rule i could pass the mockitorule to my rule so this approach would work:    mockitorulelenientstubbing(() -> {  }) || @digulla thank you for reporting! some feedback:- the code looks really hard to read (many lines of mock interactions) i suggest to rethink testing strategy refactor the code under test so that it is easier to test or roll out hand mocks- given above we cannot consider it as a legit use case we want to avoid implementing features / api for code that should be cleaned up / refactored for simplicity and testability- given that #840 solves this use case (strictness method on the rule object) im closing this ticketah it was interesting to refresh my memory about this ticket :) hope that helps! || @mockitoguy  sorry that doesnt help at allwith ~200k on stackoverflow that was the most simple solution i could come up with youre welcome to show me a better solutionthe testing strategy is sound it doesnt break easily or unexpectedly and is easy to understand for new members of the team i could copy only the necessary lines to new tests but that would mean i would be the only one who can write new tests also: violates dryrefactoring is not possible zk is a ui framework with a huge code base and many projects use it asking to change the api is like asking to """"fix"""" the java collections api: understandable maybe even reasonable but unrealistichand mocks would mean i would have to write about a lot of useless code which violates your own rule to keep tests simpleso im between a rock and a hard place: youre right for open source projects which no one uses or green field commercial projects for existing commercial projects that i cant move its not helpful they have ugly and unmodifiable apis so i have to move the only place where i have influence: thats the testsso for now i have to disable a good feature of mockito and can no longer make sure that my tests stay clean that really sucks || thank you for describing your context! let me think about this and ill get back || i guess my use case is """"im writing a mocking framework for some commercial api which helps other developers to write tests"""" that means ill always overmock in my case i have to mock several map-like apis which are exposed in several beans without a common interface (just like the attribute maps in j2ee servletcontext and servletrequest and the headers in servletresponse) || @digulla that pretty much matches my use case too imho a good solution would be to be able to specify â€˜silentâ€™ at mocked object level rather that the test class level  || i like the idea of adding new public api for this use case@digulla with my earlier reply i did not intend to depreciate your efforts in getting clean tests for your entire team itâ€™s great that youâ€™re pushing for this!the use case you describe could be solved more cleanly with hand stubs sometimes simpler code is actually more code :) what do you think about this idea: - noop implementation of the 3rd party interface generated automatically with ide cheap to maintain regardless of amount of methods because they are all noop low to zero cognitive overhead for the team - hand stub implementation extends the noop implementation tailored for what exactly the tests needcoming back to mockito for this use case i bet that our users would disable strictness per entire test rather than build hand stubs (even if hand stubs would be a better solution) disabling strictness per entire test nullifies strictness benefits to provide best dev experience mockito should honor this use case and offer a better apithere are 2 main alternatives:1) strictness per mock as suggested```javamock(fooclass withsettings()strictness(strictnesslenient))mock(fooclass withsettings()lenient()) //alias```2) strictness per stubbing for example:```javalenient()when(mockfoo())thenreturn(â€œbooâ€)lenient()doreturn(â€œbooâ€)when(mock)foo()```any feedback?thank you guys for feedback and for pushing us to reconsider were trying to keep mockito api slim and avoid solving use cases better solved by refactoring / cleanup the code || i did wonder about something like ```@mock (strictness strictnesslenient) private foo mockfoo```as well but i wonder if that syntax would over-encourage people to use the feature ime i think the sort of test frameworks fixtures etc where i see this to be most useful probably use the mock(fooclass) mechanism for instantiating mocks  || @mockitoguy >there are 2 main alternatives:i see a third one as discussed in the junit 5 pr (#1221) and the [mockito google group](https://groupsgooglecom/forum/#!topic/mockito/r1l1ag2rgbq) i would like to propose an annotation base approach that can be applied also at test-class and test-method level this keeps the api consistent and slim (at least when junit5 is used)```@mock@strictness(lenient)foo mock``` || @christianschwarz youre right! sorry for discounting the annotation option || i plan to tidy up this ticket in the next few days so that it documents the use case the implementation options and the desired implementation@christianschwarz strictness per method is not an ideal solution for the use case described in this ticket: 1 every time someone uses shared stub object he needs to remember to use lenient strictness on the method level 2 method level strictness turns off useful stubbing validation for all mocks in the method rather than only for the mocks that really need it 3 it does not communicate the intent well the reader of the test method does not know why lenient strictness is needed for method this also can lead to cargo culting - developer copy paste-ing test methods along with strictness setting without known why they need iti must admit that the @strictness annotation does look handsome in the test :)what do you think about option 1 and 2? do we want to implement both? perhaps we start with mock level annotation for now it solves the use case very well and is not very controversial || @mockitoguy > @christianschwarz strictness per method is not an ideal solution for the use case described in this ticket:thats why i proposed to use the `@strictness` annotation at field level for this use-case too the `@strictness` annotation at field level would also fit into the annotation proposal for junit5  this in return would lead to a clean single api where strictness is defined at field method and class level the same way using `@strictness`> what do you think about option 1 and 2? i would prefer option 1 cause: * it feels consistent with other mock setting configurations * it allows to implement the annotation based proposal too * option 2 would add an other alias like api for stubbing thats uncool>do we want to implement both? option1 + `@strictness` ? yes!>perhaps we start with mock level annotation for now it solves the use case very well and is not very controversial`@mock` + `@strictness()`  or `@mock(strictness)` ? i would opt for `@strictness()`  cause it allows more uses cases || >thats why i proposed to use the @strictness annotation at field level for this use-case toothats fair!lets discuss the 2 contention points:1 it is awkward that some mock properties are configured as parameter of the existing @mock annotation while some other (strictness) is a standalone annotation2 we need to support strictness at mock level via imperative api eg """"withsettings()lenient()"""" method (or something like that) this is one of our principles of api development (which we should document :) annotations are """"syntax sugar"""" - all mockito features are available via imperative api given that we implement """"withsettings()lenient()"""" why do we need @strictness annotation at all? im pushing on this because the only thing better than clean api is clean and simple api the less methods annotations complexity - the better! || @mockitoguy  re """"hand stubbed"""": that doesnt work since java doesnt allow multiple inheritance i just pasted a small part of the actual test setup my setup class can mock several aspects of the zk api: session and request attributes event queues view models injection what i end up with a mix of lenient and dedicated mockswith a hand stubbed approach i would have to copy a lot of code from test to test my goal is to have lenient mocks for unimportant parts like session attributes (code under test will complain when they are missing) but strict checking for things like events published (i really dont want to miss those)the test can then say """"hey wire up event publishing"""" if they expect events without the setup any code using events will just crash with npe with the setup mockito should complain when no events related code was executed to keep the tests clean (to avoid devs doing copy&paste of code they dont understand)re annotations: i dont think that the annotations are a good solution here they are nice for code which needs to be migrated from old mockito but for new code they are too coarse for all my use caseson the other hand i dont like the idea of having to add `withsettings()lenient()` in many places it would be great if i could execute a bunch of stub calls in a single lenient code block if that was possible id opt for an annotation on the setup method which calls the `when()`/`doreturn()` but i dont think there is an easy way to implement this when the setup method is not inside the test class but in a junit `@rule` implementation || thank you for reply! im still interested in your use case hence my further questions>with a hand stubbed approach i would have to copy a lot of code from test to test why? hand stub implementation should have all the common reusable code in the test you can just call """"mocksetupeventpublishing()"""" or something like that>on the other hand i dont like the idea of having to add withsettings()lenient() in many places it would be great if i could execute a bunch of stub calls in a single lenient code blockprovided that we add both: stubbing + mock level strictness setting then you have 2 options:1 only add """"withsettings()lenient()"""" at mock creation time only for mocks that act as """"reusable business stubs"""" (wasnt sure how to call them) when you write stubbings you dont specify """"lenient()""""2 for other cases where you have a default stubbing reused in most of the test methods you declare the default stubbing using """"lenient()"""" method at the stubbing levelthoughts? || @mockitoguy thanks i feel that i dont have a completely clear picture yet> hand stubso a base class with a lot of empty methods and then using spy() to overwrite them? that might work but i dont like spy() (had too many problems with that approach in the past)it still feels like more effort than simply wire some map methods to api methods using `answer`> 2 optionsoption #1 is too coarse for me with option #2 i would have to add 7 lines of code to the block in https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/792#issuecomment-344198135 and you were complaining that the code was already too complicated :-)thats why i suggested to have an """"enable some options for a code"""" block approach in my case i could then wrap the call to the `setupdesktopattributes()` method with that || >so a base class with a lot of empty methods and then using spy() to overwrite them?hand stub/mock is a class that is completely tailored for the business of your tests sometimes referred as """"test fixture code"""" """"test utils"""" """"test support classes"""" hand mocks dont use mockito not even spy() hand stub needs to be coded and maintained but it provides superior readability and usefulness because it is tailored to your domain>option #1 is too coarse for me with option #2 i would have to add 7 lines of code to the blockwe could potentially provide a method like:```javamockitolenient(() -> {  })```not sure about this though its a very different api than what we have so far per-mock + per-stubbing leniency feels like a happy medium: if repeated """"lenient()"""" is a problem you can configure it per the entire mock per-mock is coarse grained but on the other hand it is conventional and simple big """"lenient"""" block might lead to weird test code developers putting more code inside the block the intent of the code getting obscured || updated the description with the problem statement and proposed api changes feedback before we start coding? || update: work in progress in pr #1272friendly ping for review of the design outlined in this ticket description! || im pondering the two api designs: `mock( withsettings()lenient())` and `lenient()when()`i feel it would be better if the two were more similarwhy not `when( withsettings()lenient())`? that way the api would be more symmetric when adding more settings they would naturally flow into the existing code but it would be hard to add options only for `mock()` ( problems can only be discovered at runtime)what about  `mock()lenient()`? or `lenient()mock()`? that would be the opposite approach to make the two apis similar here the chaining pattern can make sure that you cant use options that are illegalalso this is shorter i feel `withsettings()` adds a lot of visual bloat || > im pondering the two api designs: mock( withsettings()lenient()) and lenient()when()i feel it would be better if the two were more similaryeah possibly we also want to have those new api methods consistent / similar with the existing api: - currently the way to configure mocks is: withsettings() or annotation - stubbing is inconsistent (when vs doreturn when vs given) due to the api evolution and java limitations there is no concept of configuring a """"stubbing"""" in mockito api currently (assuming that declaring what happens when stubbed method is called is part of the stubbing and not an operation of """"configuring stubbing"""")> why not ```when( withsettings()lenient())?```how would this play with doreturn syntax?> what about ```mock()lenient()?``` or ```lenient()mock()?```the former is not possible because ```mock()``` returns the type were mocking the latter is interesting problem is that it is inconsistent with how currently mocks are configured (withsettings())thank you for thoughtful feedback!

do you suggest adding new """"initmock()"""" method? do you suggest vararg or consecutive invocation or both? i would suggest to go for the simplest compatible api change - keeping the existing method just making it vararg will you be able to work on this?@marcphilipp - thank you for suggestions! for internal refactorings we are pretty open - do what you think is good for the codebase for public api changes/additions we push back by default and we make sure that the use case is very compellingthanks!!! || i would say we can change it to a vararg this ticket basically addresses https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1221/files#diff-6d0d68d3f3e6a783328fbe723a822668r36 which is unfortunate to do right now if we change it to vararg we can transform the `testclassinstances` list to an array and make it work :tada:  || "";1;0;merge branch release/2x into issues/1232-session-additions;"

what does """"cleanly exclude the bytebuddy subdirectory"""" mean? || interceptedinvocation is used by all mockmakers hence if you want to order it correctly it should not be in a bytebuddy specific directorythere are currently two ways to build mockito without bytebuddy1 just load mockito-core and exclude netbytebuddy this leaves the bytebuddy-mockmaker in place hence there will be unresolved references into net-bytebuddy this still works as none of these references will be called and (at least on android) loading something with unresolved references just throws some log messages but nothing worse2 you can also take mockito-core unpack it and remove the dependency on netbytebuddy and remove the whole src/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy folder then you have no references into net-bytebuddy to be able to do this you need this change to clean up the directory structure of mockito as described above also if you even wanted to produce a byte-buddy-less version of mockito this change would be the first you would make || regarding my last comment: during a regular android-gradle build we run a lint checker which finds the issue (1) in my last comment you can suppress this and you are good though || thank you for explanation i updated the title and im absolutely merging! || "";improve automation: fix binary comparison - avoidance of uncessary publication;the binary comparison does not work:- some problem with serializablenoop- poms are always different due to changed version;@szczepiq want to close this one ?

parameter resolution between test methodsi always thought that was a _cool_ feature of the original prototype but i can understand your rationale for omitting that feature however id make sure its very well documented in the user guide etc for mockitootherwise users will likely get confused quite quickly || in contrast to field names -- which are always user-defined -- i would also make a special note in the documentation that the default name for a mock created for a parameter will be something very ugly like `arg0` instead of the user-defined name **unless** the code has been compiled on java 8+ with the `-parameters` flag || regarding that latter in the prototype we added explicit support for determining the mock name here:https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/7bf40178345d5ca837579c8ddb8c025401a98788/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionjava#l64 _and_ we did not create the mock with a custom name if the user did not provide a custom nameso id suggest mockito do something similar || > id make sure its very well documented in the user guide etc for mockitoi think the javadoc of `mockitoextension` is quite explicit about this do you have any suggestions to extend it?> i would also make a special note in the documentation that the default namegood call will do> we did not create the mock with a custom name if the user did not provide a custom namewe can use the type name indeed || > i think the javadoc of mockitoextension is quite explicit about this do you have any suggestions to extend it?well as the code is currently implemented `supportsparameter()` will return `true` for any parameter annotated with `@mock` whether such a parameter is in a _constructor_ `@beforeall`/`@afterall` `@beforeeach`/`@aftereach` `@test` method etcand it _sounds_ like you wish to restrict usage to `@test` `@testfactory` `@parameterizedtest` and `@repeatedtest` methodsor maybe you dont want to restrict it?but its unclear what is supported and what isnti think your goal is to restrict sharing of parameter-injected mock instances between setup and test methods so you might want to restrict mock injection for lifecycle callback methodson the other hand it would be a perfectly valid use case to have a mock injected into a constructor and then store it in a `private final` field (ie immutability)in summary youll need to think through the possible use cases and document which ones you actually support and the implementation should only return `true` from `supportsparameter()` if mockito actually supports the use case || oh i was not aware of all these cases i thought it was only for test methods have to think about what we do want to support (maybe it all magically works already with this implementation) || sure id recommend you _play around_ with it a bit to get a feel for whats possiblethen youll be better equipped to make an informed decision ðŸ˜‰  || +1 for sharing i think `@beforeeach void f(@mock x)` `@test void f(@mock x)` could be the same object @timvdlippe as i read youre clearing the session after each test so sharing between methods would affect a single test method execution || @twisterrob please see https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/1348#issuecomment-376295133 for the full explanation || @timvdlippe> maybe it all magically works already with this implementationyes that should be the casebut i still think the mockito team should provide guidance for end users demonstrating best practices when using the `mockitoextension` for junit jupiterfor example if it were my project id make sure that there are tests in place and documented examples demonstrating parameter injection for constructors lifecycle methods testable methods (eg `@test` `@testfactory` etc) _and_ id cover the use of `@testinstance(per_class)` semantics as wellim sure that either i or someone else from the junit team would be happy to review your work before you publish it ðŸ˜‰  || for reference https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/1345 is the issue that is blocking this pr for now but the upstream issue is actively being worked on atm || thank you guys for working on this! || the junit issue has been resolved on their master (https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/1345#issuecomment-378229606) so we have to wait for a new release and then i can continue working on this pr || @timvdlippe i wouldt hold off on working on this pr just to wait on junit jupiter 52 to be releasedthat will literally take months plus it would prevent mockito users from using the feature with junit jupiter 51x (unless we backport the convenience methods to 51x)for example in spring framework 505 (likely being released today) i already added [custom support](https://githubcom/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/9244090ba04011902568aba4b854668312c025e1) for the jdk bug so that spring users arent affected by the issue even on junit jupiter 50x || > unless we backport the convenience methods to 51xas a user i would strongly appreciate a backport have to think whether we would like to maintain this code ourselves (like spring does) or whether we simply note the limitation that this will be addressed in the next release of junit || sure maintaining the """"workaround"""" is a personal decision you have to makeas for appreciating a backport feel free to voice your opinion on the related junit jupiter issue (which i reopened for that purpose) ðŸ˜‰  || per https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/1345#issuecomment-378632027 this will be backported to junit 511 we just have to wait till that release is out and then i can finish up this pr :tada:  || @timvdlippe looks like 511 released couple of hours back :)https://searchmavenorg/#artifactdetails%7corgjunitjupiter%7cjunit-jupiter-engine%7c511%7cjar || awesome constructor parameter resolution has been fixed! @mockito/core ptal || ðŸ‘  || will this be getting released soon?  thank you! || this is still awaiting review of @mockito/core  || i finished reviewing and im happy to merge! theres some issue with our travis build at the moment but we should merge soon! || i rebased and will wait for travis feedback before merging || "";support @mock injection in junit 5 method parameters;""junit 5 has the ability to """"inject"""" parameters into test methods via an extensible ``parameterresolver`` interface  the junit 5 users guide provides an example that shows how such a ``parameterresolver`` can supply mock objects as test parameters as follows (shamelessly copied from https://junitorg/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dependency-injection):```@extendwith(mockitoextensionclass)class mymockitotest {    @beforeeach    void init(@mock person person) {        when(persongetname())thenreturn(""""dilbert"""")    }    @test    void simpletestwithinjectedmock(@mock person person) {        assertequals(""""dilbert"""" persongetname())    }}```the prototype ``mockitoextension`` provided in the junit 5 samples project shows a simple implementation of the required ``supportsparameter()`` and ``resolveparameter()`` methods (see: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/r510/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionjava)[ ]   add the ability to inject mock objects into test method parameters to the official ``mockitoextension``  references #445"";""i am ðŸ‘ for this feature with the following use case:initialization of local variable mocks previously this would be `mock<generic> mock  mock(mockclass)` however this loses the type-signature of `generic` with parameter mocks we can do `@mock mock<generic> mock` and still maintain the generic type signature || i should also note that i havent personally used parameter resolution the way its shown above  our team generally either injects the mock object at the class level and configures it in ``@beforeeach`` **or** we inject the mock object in the test method and configure it at the top of the test methods block || yes agreed rather than some """"magic"""" shared by methods i think a generics-type-safe replacement for local mock initialization is a lot better || i just edited the description of this issue to include a link to the sample ``mockitoextension`` (i had intended to provide that reference originally)  i dont know if id refer to the the methods sharing the parameter instance as """"magic"""" but without looking at the code it certainly isnt clear that the parameters are the shared if the types and names match  i definitely think that there are use-cases for this technique and the use of ``extensioncontextstore`` is a great way to provide references to objects from different methods  my main concern is that when there is a name collision and the types match you might end up with behavior thats really hard to understand (without knowing how the underlying extension works)im not sure im a fan of the syntax you described above as it seems more redundant than ``@mock myweirdthing myweirdmock`` - im guessing im misunderstanding your intention (i get the erasure part) || in junit 4 local mock initialization would be ```javaclass test {  @test  public void test() {    mock<string> mock  mockitomock(mockclass)  }  class mock<t> {}}```this would issue a warning saying that the generic type of `string` is not correctly created by `mockitomock` (even though we know that our mocks will work)with this feature in junit 5 we can have:```javaclass test {  @test  public void test(@mock mock<string> mock) {  }  class mock<t> {}}```and the compiler will not warn any longer || i dont remember ever seeing that warning - perhaps because ive always used the mockito runner or rule? || correct you do not get that warning when using the runner but then you have mocks that are used in every single test this targets the use case where you need 1 extra mock in only 1 testcase || and if the ``mockitoextension`` is the junit 5 replacement for the runner or rule why wouldnt those warnings also be suppressed? || because the point of mock initialization is different junit 4 only supported for attributes we are now talking about method parameters hopefully when i implement this logic it is more clear to you ðŸ˜„  || im not trying to be argumentative  but as a pretty heavy user of the prototype ``mockitoextension`` in the https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples project wed have a lot of tests to update with this syntax  well also need to make sure the example in the users guide and (if theyre kept) the code in the junit-samples project matches the official implementation  at this point i should probably let junit-team (i wish i could use a mention here) coordinate that with you@sbrannen @marcphilipp @sormuras || looking at the source of https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/7bf40178345d5ca837579c8ddb8c025401a98788/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionjava i think we should be fine i will let you know when the pr is open so that you can test that outone note: the mockito team was not involved with the development of the prototype but i think we will approach very similar capabilities || i was looking at https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/master/junit5-mockito-extension/src/test/java/com/example/mockito/mockitoextensionwithnestedtestsjava because its got a bunch of use cases including test-local mocks and the """"magic"""" you referred to above  thinking though the syntax change youre describing ill assume that the tests would still run but with the same warning?i do realize that the mockito team didnt produce the prototype and it would be unrealistic to think that you should be permanently limited by it architecturally  i did however think that the syntax """"proposed"""" by the prototype was consistent with the field injection that already existed in mockito  im going to assume that what is produced as the official extension will be well integrated and well maintained - and i never complain about stable tooling! || opened #1350 with a proposal implementation || okay to write down the reason i think mock sharing by parameter is not a good idea:first of all there is a lot of duplicate code for every test method you need to list the mocks which results in duplicate rather using fields for these mocks removes the duplicationsecondly by relying on fields the compiler will complain when you make a typo (or change a type) with parameters you rely on the name (string-based) and the type declared both are not compiler safelastly because you can rely on fields refactoring is a lot easier as ides support renaming by field this is not possible for parametersfor these 3 reasons i see field mock sharing superior to parameter mock sharing and am therefore against introducing this logic in the parameter resolution || > for these 3 reasons i see field mock sharing superior to parameter mock sharing and am therefore against introducing this logic in the parameter resolutioni totally understand the rationale ðŸ‘  || what about support for `@spy` and `@captor`? should new issues be created or can it be part of this one? || `@spy` makes no sense as it requires a concrete instance `@captor` could be done lets discuss that in a different issue :+1: as this issue has been resolved || my memory was incorrect as #1350 has

jdk10 and kotlin (and java) || @raphw iâ€™ve just tried `2173` from `dlbintraycom/mockito/maven` with `bytebuddy:181` and this kind of errors still happens this happened for me after migrating from jdk 8 to jdk 9 a coworker of mine updated his android studio from 30 to 31 and observes the same thing in ide (running tests via gradle works fine though) this version of as actually bundles jdk 8 but the updated revision (i guess) weâ€™ve tried the `2173` as well with no luck || seems like some jdk internals were switched out such that byte buddy tries to instrument classes that it needs itself to apply the instrumentation this requiressome whitelisting on our side i believe || also seeing this when running tests for spek 2x (spekframework/spek#318) on jdk9 https://travis-ciorg/patrickpilch/spek/jobs/346058522ive tried forcing the byte buddy version to 183 but the problem remained<details><summary>complete stacktrace</summary><p>```mockito cannot mock

- [x] the pull request follows coding style - [x] mention `fixes #<issue number>` in the description _if relevant_ - [x] at least one commit should mention `fixes #<issue number>` _if relevant_;would

assume that use you the latest version of mockito and byte buddy provided by it) || @szpak your intuition is correct  i am using spring boot version `205release` and it is using an older version of the mockito library  in order to use the newest mockito i had to change my gradle config:```    testcompile(orgspringframeworkboot:spring-boot-starter-test) {        exclude group: """"orgmockito"""" module: """"mockito-core""""    }    testcompile(""""orgmockito:mockito-core:2234"""")```that fixed my errors  thank you for the help || great to hearbtw spring boot provides also an easier way to override dependency [versions](https://docsspringio/platform/docs/cairo-build-snapshot/reference/html/getting-started-overriding-versionshtml) here overriding mockito would be enoughbtw afair only spring boot 21 declared java 11 compatibility therefore you may want to upgrade to prevent further surprises :) || > testcompile(orgspringframeworkboot:spring-boot-starter-test) {>         exclude

docs](https://docscodecovio/docs/pull-request-comments) ||;@mock-annotated fields are null for inner test classes (eg when using junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner);using the two current versions of mockito (11019 and 2x-beta) and the junit-mockito-rule together with junit extensions like [junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner](https://githubcom/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner/) that use inner classes causes fails with `nullpointerexception`s:``` java@runwith(hierarchicalcontextrunnerclass)public class hierarchicalmockitotest {    @rule    public mockitorule mockitorule  mockitojunitrule()    @mock    private runnable runnable    public class context {        @test        public void test() throws exception {            runnablerun()        }    }}```with older 1x versions that didnt not contain the new junit rule api (eg where `mockitojunitrule` was not deprecated yet) the above test pass i guess the reason is that the old rules constructor had the current test instance passed in in newer versions the rule uses the `target` from `orgjunitrulesmethodrule#apply()` which in this example is an instance of `hierarchicalmockitotestcontext` so the `@mock`-annotated fields of the outer classes are not seen and the mocks wont get instantiated;@ursmetz this is not yet supported feel free to craft a pull request for that ) || @bric3 i will look into that and eventually craft a pull requestmaybe it was not clear from my original post: this is a regression because when updating to the latest 1x release tests like the one above will fail: when though the constructor of `mockitojunitrule` gets the target (eh `this`) passed it doesnt use it in the newest version and as a consequence the test fails with a `nullpointerexeception` earlier version used the parameter so that the mocks got initiated and the test was green so even when the old now deprecated api is used tests start to fail after updating mockito so maybe a back port to the 1x branch should be considered too? || oh i didnt get that indeed actually the this was removed because junit passes the target when the rule is applied see [mockitojunitrule](https://githubcom/bric3/mockito/blob/master/src/main/java/org/mockito/junit/mockitojunitrulejava#l39-l39) with these _exotic_ junit runners im not sure how to solve this in a proper way maybe adding a hierarchical mockito rule || or maybe with such exotic runner the pr could be on their project ? https://githubcom/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner/ || i was also thinking whether it is not a issue with the junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner i will investigate this and either raise an issue over there (and reference this issue) or take a stab at a fix and pull request for mockito im not one hundred percent sure whether it worked in all corner case with the old version where the parameter of `mockitojunitrule` was used instead of the parameter `target` of the `apply` method of the rule i will also look into that || @bric3 after playing a bit around with the example above and different versions of mockito (pre 11017 where the internal implementation of the junit rule changed and > 11017) i figured out that only some corner cases worked in the old version (exactly those we are using right now in my team at work) now different case work and the old cases stopped working as you said it seems to be an issue with junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner i raised the issue bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner#26 over there || @ursmetz cool if youre ok with that lets close the issue there ? || sure im closing it || cool thanks :) || i think there is still a bug with junitrule  i built the master branch of the project which includes @ursmetzs pull request in that project and ran the sample test class at the top but i received the following exception prior to reaching the code that causes the nullpointerexception  the root cause is junitrule attempting to add a universaltestlistener a second time to a threadsafemockingprocess (mockito currently does not readily provide the full stack trace at this time)```orgmockitoexceptionsmisusingunfinishedmockingsessionexception: unfinished mocking session detectedprevious mockitosession was not concluded with finishmocking()for examples of correct usage

results in hierarchicaljunitruletestjava failing due to the unfinishedmockingsessionexception i cited previouslythis issue would have happened with any runner that enabled hierarchical test classes ([such as the nitorcreations nestedrunner](https://githubcom/nitorcreations/corecomponents/tree/master/junit-runners))  junitrule overwrites the mockitosession instantiated in the outer call in the nested case this seems wrong and it seems reasonable to augment the existing session with the mocks from the inner classi havent submitted a pr at this time eventhough the test suite passed because i have no idea if my changes are oblivious to other exception cases  but i would like to re-open a discussion on this ticket since i still believe this is a legitimate issue  thanks || @mouyang i had a quick look at it (i dont know why but i had to tweak `gradlebuild` in your repo a bit further so that the `junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner` snapshot version in my local maven repository was found as a `testcompile` dependency: i had to add a top level `repositories` section with `mavenlocal()` in it)i can reproduce your error when using some 2x versions of mockito (i tried 2130 210-beta125 and the master)with a mockito version 1x and 200-beta118 i cannot reproduce the failureso at the time when i was working on this it worked(tm) -) but with the current 2x version it is broken so i think youre right that there is an issue (please note that im not a maintainer of mockito i just saw that there was some activity on an old issue i once created) || from your clarifications it makes more sense to keep this ticket closed and for me to create a new ticket for my issue as it is clearly different thanks @ursmetz! ||;1;0;fixes #1578: append mocks to existing mockitosession- problem - junitrule detects an unfinished mocking session when the apply method is invoked more than once  this commonly happens with runners that enable developers to write nested test classes- fix - if a mockitosession has been established for junitrule then use that and initialize any new mocks (typically from a nested test class)- test - instantiate one @rule and assign it to a second one  this will simulate the apply method being invoked more than once without introducing a new test dependency;

docs](https://docscodecovio/docs/pull-request-comments) || thank you for the pr! since this is changing / adding new public api i will review it too (many thanks to @timvdlippe for offering to review this!) ill commit to provide review by the end of this week || thanks to @mockitoguy just some context here i tried to avoid new api at first but `defaultmockitosession` seems (at least from tests) to be used within a thread and changing its default behavior to listen on events from all threads will break tests for multi-threading therefore i came up with the new api solutioni didnt know how much impact there would be to add a new method in `mockmaker` interface that requires everyone providing an implementation when they uprev their mockito to a version that has the new method but i have no clue how much work it could be if its too noisy maybe we can have a default impl (if only java 8+ is supported) or a brand new interface called `inlinemockmaker` to add that method i personally want to expose a chance to mock makers to clean up as we dont know how they handle the mapping from mock to its handler which may have other places that could cause memory leaks other than those 2 places we found we need better documentation on that but i have to admit im not good at writing api docs so ill defer to any of your suggestions in terms of documentationi hope the review wont later become a whole refactor of current implementation || i reviewed the implementation and most of it is really good it is also a very high quality pr thank you! curious are you facing this problem at g?i have a couple of concerns / design choices to discuss: a) can we make the fix more seamless? im not sure if this is possible but lets discuss goals: users dont have to remember to use trackandcleanupmocks() _when_ inline mocker is in use for example (brainstorming): 	- we introduce a new interface that inlinebytebuddymockmaker implements say: requirescleaningmocks 	- we expose a new method like frameworkgetplugins()getplugin(mockmackerclass) this way we can find out in runtime what mockmaker is in use 	- in mockito session we check if the mock maker is requirescleaningmocks 	- in session we call requirescleaningmockscleanupmock() b) mockmakercleanupmock() is an incompatible change so we cannot ship this pr in its current form mockmaker is typically provided at runtime from a different jar (example: dexmaker powermockito) i have a couple ideas but first lets explore a) great tests deep change in the internals of mockito thank you very much for the contribution!  || thanks for your review @mockitoguy dexmaker is incubating a feature in inline-dexmaker to create spies without creating new instances so that we can stub final members and we (android framework) found these mem leaks when using that i then found #1533 and reproduced #1614 that i confirmed it also happens with bytebuddy mock makers so i started the fix with help from @timvdlippe first of all i really didnt see a solution w/o tying mock lives with something and i think `mockitosession` is the most natural choice for the """"something"""" so technically its already not transparent to properly use inline mock makers because sessions are necessary to make it work while its optional to use subclass mock makersi also first tried to avoid `trackandcleanupmocks()` the difficulty actually comes from the fact mockitolisteners are threadlocal before this change and its a requirement to track mocks generated from other threads because [`failontimeout`][failontimeout] basically runs tests in different threads than the thread used to run before and after before this change user can have multiple `defaultmockitosession` as long as they are in different threads (`threadsrunalltestshalfmanualtest` also verifies that behavior) and not interfering with each other however if we convert `defaultmockitosession` to have """"thread global"""" influence `threadrunalltestshalfmanualtest` will fail because cross-threads mock cleanup will invalidate mocks created in tests running in a different threadi think i have a way (a bit hacky though) to make it work but i dont think its complication outweighs the new api (given that its already not transparent to users) it doesnt encourage clean tests in multi-threading scenario either imho however i can still put my thought here and let you decide if we should take it:- dont reject registration of global listeners if its from a different thread for the same type- only clean up mocks when the last `mocktracker` is unregisteredthen it basically treats the life of any `defaultmockitosession` as mock lives it doesnt allow user to precisely control mock lives but with some care users should still be able to avoid oom[failontimeout]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock() im not sure if the plugin way is still preferred over current change because for most dexmakers theyre still just implementing the basic `mockmaker` interface and nothing should break while they can choose to implement `inlinemockmaker` if clean up is necessary || just to be clear that im waiting for @mockitoguy s response on if we would like to go for that approach in exchange of removing trackandcleanupmocks() api just in case were waiting for each other and its going nowhere || as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is :+1: for me :smile:  || hey @ttanxu so you youre saying that the approach i suggested in a) wouldnt work? || > oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock()great! ill review again this weekend || > as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is ðŸ‘ for me ðŸ˜„@timvdlippe im with you its a good idea to have a separate interface and stay compatible || hey @mockitoguy  what you suggested could solve the same issue that is solved by `inlinemockmaker` in current pr (the mockmaker contract breakage)`trackandcleanupmocks()` was introduced for other reason but could use different tech to remove its necessity i explained the detail in previous comments (mostly because of the multi-thread implementation of [`failontimeout`][1] in junit)[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || @ttanxu thank you for explanation im looking into it || my comment is short but i put a lot of consideration into this given all arguments i agree that a new api is the best way before we ship it i want to bounce one more idea what if we tie mockmaker with mockitosession? when the session completes it tears down its mockmaker/cleans up all mocks we could use threadlocal thoughts? || correct me if im wrongit seems youre suggesting one `mockmaker` per thread the critical part of this approach is the mock map in the inline mock maker needs to be a `threadlocal` which means mocks wont look have handlers tied to them in threads other than the thread where they were created and thus wont appear to be a mock and method invocations on it might trigger exceptions thats not likely a compatible change to existing use cases because if [`failontimeout`][1] is used befores and afters are executed in a different thread than the test methodif we still only have one `mockmaker` across all threads then the structure is pretty much the same as current change except that instead of calling `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` we just tear down the entire `mockmaker` im not sure if this is better than calling `clearup()` it does sound like a viable solution w/o introduction to `inlinemockmaker` as we can just swap the instance of `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` the con is thats more of a systematic refactor than `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` approach and it reduces the cleanness of current code (we cant use final for `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` anymore) btw this doesnt help avoid a new api `trackandclearupmocks()` in `mockitosession` ill leave this decision to you[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || great points thank you for taking the time to explain why do we need to keep track of specific mocks? can we just clear all? || oh you say we dont have to save created mocks in a list in `mocktracker`? i guess we can just clear all mocks especially considering there cant be multiple mock-tracking sessions open at the same time mocks created before the session is opened may be leakedremoving `mocktracker` can simply this change a lot especially we dont need global listeners ill update the change || actually i recall that the thought of tracking specific mocks stemmed from the thought that usually mocks have different lives eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different lives it would be nice if we can keep mocks created in beforeclass for later reusecurrent impl is half baked because there can only be one tracking session but i want to keep `cleanup(object)` signature (or we can have `cleanup(object)` instead so that we can clean up everything if object array is `null`) for `inlinemockmaker` just in case we want to support the case abovewith that said ill change `cleanup(object)` to `cleanup(object)` and use `null` array for clean up everything || oh besides if we just want to clear everything it doesnt seem natural to me to add the api to mockitosession maybe we can add an api to mockito? || thank you for considering! i want us to strive for simplicity ill think about the new api for mockito (or mockitoframework)if we have a static method like """"mockitoframework()clearallmocks()"""" would it work for you? > eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different livesdo we know legit use cases for """"static"""" mocks? it seems an anti-pattern || finally cleaned up all remains from previous change its a lot simpler now please take a looki can think of a case for static mocks where constructing a mock may be expensive and someone wants to reuse it across tests thats not an argument why static mocks have to be used though they can definitely reconstruct those mocks || reviewing || we are ready thank you @ttanxu and @timvdlippe for patience! this is the best pragmatic step to resolve the problem in the future perhaps we can avoid having the weak map of references in a first place@ttanxu i made some tweaks to tests documentation ive also renamed the method to """"clearmocks() -> clearinlinemocks()"""" for consistency take a look and see if youre ok with this let us know and ill merge this nice work with this change!@timvdlippe i did some cosmetic changes please review if you want thanks! || i will review this on monday in the office thanks for the polish! || > test user can safely call clearinlinemocks() and clearmock() even when mock maker is not a inline mock maker@ttanxu great point! || im making the final tweaks based on the code review and im merging || this is awesome thank you guys! iâ€™ll try this api on our codebase and samples iâ€™ve provided in original issues also â€”Â kudos for including tests reproducing the behavior iâ€™ve described ðŸ˜‰  || hi just to let you know i am using the new api already with v2282 and for me it was

sorry for the ping but the situation gets worse on our side is the issue with mockito or we are just using it the wrong way? || cc @raphw  || you are right due to the reference of one mock to another the weak map is loosing its effecttechnically we would need to make the spy reference weak to break the cross reference but i sm not sure how this can be achieved without risking to have the references collected prematurely  || @raphw thanks for the explanation! if it is more or less intended â€” maybe letâ€™s document it somewhere? another option is throwing an exception or printing a warning in such cases since we werenâ€™t aware of this and use mockito quite a lot we got ourselves in a pretty bad oom situation finding nested spies by hand is a tedeous task not even sure i can automate it without library support iâ€™m afraid people will continue to do this not understanding the consequencescan i ask you to take a look at #1533 as well? i think it is pretty similar or even exactly the same in terms of the root issue || it is surely not expected behavior and i consider it a bug however i do not know how to solve this and i even doubt that it is solvable without a data structure that is called an https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/ephemeron and which java does not (currently) supportbut we should definitely document this || just checked mockito 2270 using the new `mockitoframework()clearinlinemocks()` call does the trick and helps to avoid oom thanks! ||;1;0;merge branch release/2x into release/2x;"

docs](https://docscodecovio/docs/pull-request-comments) || thank you for the pr! since this is changing / adding new public api i will review it too (many thanks to @timvdlippe for offering to review this!) ill commit to provide review by the end of this week || thanks to @mockitoguy just some context here i tried to avoid new api at first but `defaultmockitosession` seems (at least from tests) to be used within a thread and changing its default behavior to listen on events from all threads will break tests for multi-threading therefore i came up with the new api solutioni didnt know how much impact there would be to add a new method in `mockmaker` interface that requires everyone providing an implementation when they uprev their mockito to a version that has the new method but i have no clue how much work it could be if its too noisy maybe we can have a default impl (if only java 8+ is supported) or a brand new interface called `inlinemockmaker` to add that method i personally want to expose a chance to mock makers to clean up as we dont know how they handle the mapping from mock to its handler which may have other places that could cause memory leaks other than those 2 places we found we need better documentation on that but i have to admit im not good at writing api docs so ill defer to any of your suggestions in terms of documentationi hope the review wont later become a whole refactor of current implementation || i reviewed the implementation and most of it is really good it is also a very high quality pr thank you! curious are you facing this problem at g?i have a couple of concerns / design choices to discuss: a) can we make the fix more seamless? im not sure if this is possible but lets discuss goals: users dont have to remember to use trackandcleanupmocks() _when_ inline mocker is in use for example (brainstorming): 	- we introduce a new interface that inlinebytebuddymockmaker implements say: requirescleaningmocks 	- we expose a new method like frameworkgetplugins()getplugin(mockmackerclass) this way we can find out in runtime what mockmaker is in use 	- in mockito session we check if the mock maker is requirescleaningmocks 	- in session we call requirescleaningmockscleanupmock() b) mockmakercleanupmock() is an incompatible change so we cannot ship this pr in its current form mockmaker is typically provided at runtime from a different jar (example: dexmaker powermockito) i have a couple ideas but first lets explore a) great tests deep change in the internals of mockito thank you very much for the contribution!  || thanks for your review @mockitoguy dexmaker is incubating a feature in inline-dexmaker to create spies without creating new instances so that we can stub final members and we (android framework) found these mem leaks when using that i then found #1533 and reproduced #1614 that i confirmed it also happens with bytebuddy mock makers so i started the fix with help from @timvdlippe first of all i really didnt see a solution w/o tying mock lives with something and i think `mockitosession` is the most natural choice for the """"something"""" so technically its already not transparent to properly use inline mock makers because sessions are necessary to make it work while its optional to use subclass mock makersi also first tried to avoid `trackandcleanupmocks()` the difficulty actually comes from the fact mockitolisteners are threadlocal before this change and its a requirement to track mocks generated from other threads because [`failontimeout`][failontimeout] basically runs tests in different threads than the thread used to run before and after before this change user can have multiple `defaultmockitosession` as long as they are in different threads (`threadsrunalltestshalfmanualtest` also verifies that behavior) and not interfering with each other however if we convert `defaultmockitosession` to have """"thread global"""" influence `threadrunalltestshalfmanualtest` will fail because cross-threads mock cleanup will invalidate mocks created in tests running in a different threadi think i have a way (a bit hacky though) to make it work but i dont think its complication outweighs the new api (given that its already not transparent to users) it doesnt encourage clean tests in multi-threading scenario either imho however i can still put my thought here and let you decide if we should take it:- dont reject registration of global listeners if its from a different thread for the same type- only clean up mocks when the last `mocktracker` is unregisteredthen it basically treats the life of any `defaultmockitosession` as mock lives it doesnt allow user to precisely control mock lives but with some care users should still be able to avoid oom[failontimeout]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock() im not sure if the plugin way is still preferred over current change because for most dexmakers theyre still just implementing the basic `mockmaker` interface and nothing should break while they can choose to implement `inlinemockmaker` if clean up is necessary || just to be clear that im waiting for @mockitoguy s response on if we would like to go for that approach in exchange of removing trackandcleanupmocks() api just in case were waiting for each other and its going nowhere || as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is :+1: for me :smile:  || hey @ttanxu so you youre saying that the approach i suggested in a) wouldnt work? || > oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock()great! ill review again this weekend || > as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is ðŸ‘ for me ðŸ˜„@timvdlippe im with you its a good idea to have a separate interface and stay compatible || hey @mockitoguy  what you suggested could solve the same issue that is solved by `inlinemockmaker` in current pr (the mockmaker contract breakage)`trackandcleanupmocks()` was introduced for other reason but could use different tech to remove its necessity i explained the detail in previous comments (mostly because of the multi-thread implementation of [`failontimeout`][1] in junit)[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || @ttanxu thank you for explanation im looking into it || my comment is short but i put a lot of consideration into this given all arguments i agree that a new api is the best way before we ship it i want to bounce one more idea what if we tie mockmaker with mockitosession? when the session completes it tears down its mockmaker/cleans up all mocks we could use threadlocal thoughts? || correct me if im wrongit seems youre suggesting one `mockmaker` per thread the critical part of this approach is the mock map in the inline mock maker needs to be a `threadlocal` which means mocks wont look have handlers tied to them in threads other than the thread where they were created and thus wont appear to be a mock and method invocations on it might trigger exceptions thats not likely a compatible change to existing use cases because if [`failontimeout`][1] is used befores and afters are executed in a different thread than the test methodif we still only have one `mockmaker` across all threads then the structure is pretty much the same as current change except that instead of calling `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` we just tear down the entire `mockmaker` im not sure if this is better than calling `clearup()` it does sound like a viable solution w/o introduction to `inlinemockmaker` as we can just swap the instance of `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` the con is thats more of a systematic refactor than `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` approach and it reduces the cleanness of current code (we cant use final for `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` anymore) btw this doesnt help avoid a new api `trackandclearupmocks()` in `mockitosession` ill leave this decision to you[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || great points thank you for taking the time to explain why do we need to keep track of specific mocks? can we just clear all? || oh you say we dont have to save created mocks in a list in `mocktracker`? i guess we can just clear all mocks especially considering there cant be multiple mock-tracking sessions open at the same time mocks created before the session is opened may be leakedremoving `mocktracker` can simply this change a lot especially we dont need global listeners ill update the change || actually i recall that the thought of tracking specific mocks stemmed from the thought that usually mocks have different lives eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different lives it would be nice if we can keep mocks created in beforeclass for later reusecurrent impl is half baked because there can only be one tracking session but i want to keep `cleanup(object)` signature (or we can have `cleanup(object)` instead so that we can clean up everything if object array is `null`) for `inlinemockmaker` just in case we want to support the case abovewith that said ill change `cleanup(object)` to `cleanup(object)` and use `null` array for clean up everything || oh besides if we just want to clear everything it doesnt seem natural to me to add the api to mockitosession maybe we can add an api to mockito? || thank you for considering! i want us to strive for simplicity ill think about the new api for mockito (or mockitoframework)if we have a static method like """"mockitoframework()clearallmocks()"""" would it work for you? > eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different livesdo we know legit use cases for """"static"""" mocks? it seems an anti-pattern || finally cleaned up all remains from previous change its a lot simpler now please take a looki can think of a case for static mocks where constructing a mock may be expensive and someone wants to reuse it across tests thats not an argument why static mocks have to be used though they can definitely reconstruct those mocks || reviewing || we are ready thank you @ttanxu and @timvdlippe for patience! this is the best pragmatic step to resolve the problem in the future perhaps we can avoid having the weak map of references in a first place@ttanxu i made some tweaks to tests documentation ive also renamed the method to """"clearmocks() -> clearinlinemocks()"""" for consistency take a look and see if youre ok with this let us know and ill merge this nice work with this change!@timvdlippe i did some cosmetic changes please review if you want thanks! || i will review this on monday in the office thanks for the polish! || > test user can safely call clearinlinemocks() and clearmock() even when mock maker is not a inline mock maker@ttanxu great point! || im making the final tweaks based on the code review and im merging || this is awesome thank you guys! iâ€™ll try this api on our codebase and samples iâ€™ve provided in original issues also â€”Â kudos for including tests reproducing the behavior iâ€™ve described ðŸ˜‰  || hi just to let you know i am using the new api already with v2282 and for me it was breaking the strict test with following exception:``` orgmockitoexceptionsmisusingnotamockexception: argument passed to mockitomockingdetails() should be a mock but is an instance of class cache$mockitomock$149288076!       at orgmockitointernalrunnersdefaultinternalrunner$1$2testfinished(defaultinternalrunnerjava:63) ```i had to move it to `@afterclass` to mitigate the problem || @s2131 you are not allowed to interact with mocks anymore after calling that api because all internal states of mocks are cleaned up after the api call that includes all delayed actions or interactions from other threadsunfortunately its never as easy as just calling that api || "";cross-references and a single spy cause memory leak;""not entirely sure but i think that mockito does not handle cross-references well i have a semi-complex sample that proves this but at the same time iâ€™m not sure it is a mockito failure and especially a fixable one suggestions how to avoid this

docs](https://docscodecovio/docs/pull-request-comments) || thank you for the pr! since this is changing / adding new public api i will review it too (many thanks to @timvdlippe for offering to review this!) ill commit to provide review by the end of this week || thanks to @mockitoguy just some context here i tried to avoid new api at first but `defaultmockitosession` seems (at least from tests) to be used within a thread and changing its default behavior to listen on events from all threads will break tests for multi-threading therefore i came up with the new api solutioni didnt know how much impact there would be to add a new method in `mockmaker` interface that requires everyone providing an implementation when they uprev their mockito to a version that has the new method but i have no clue how much work it could be if its too noisy maybe we can have a default impl (if only java 8+ is supported) or a brand new interface called `inlinemockmaker` to add that method i personally want to expose a chance to mock makers to clean up as we dont know how they handle the mapping from mock to its handler which may have other places that could cause memory leaks other than those 2 places we found we need better documentation on that but i have to admit im not good at writing api docs so ill defer to any of your suggestions in terms of documentationi hope the review wont later become a whole refactor of current implementation || i reviewed the implementation and most of it is really good it is also a very high quality pr thank you! curious are you facing this problem at g?i have a couple of concerns / design choices to discuss: a) can we make the fix more seamless? im not sure if this is possible but lets discuss goals: users dont have to remember to use trackandcleanupmocks() _when_ inline mocker is in use for example (brainstorming): 	- we introduce a new interface that inlinebytebuddymockmaker implements say: requirescleaningmocks 	- we expose a new method like frameworkgetplugins()getplugin(mockmackerclass) this way we can find out in runtime what mockmaker is in use 	- in mockito session we check if the mock maker is requirescleaningmocks 	- in session we call requirescleaningmockscleanupmock() b) mockmakercleanupmock() is an incompatible change so we cannot ship this pr in its current form mockmaker is typically provided at runtime from a different jar (example: dexmaker powermockito) i have a couple ideas but first lets explore a) great tests deep change in the internals of mockito thank you very much for the contribution!  || thanks for your review @mockitoguy dexmaker is incubating a feature in inline-dexmaker to create spies without creating new instances so that we can stub final members and we (android framework) found these mem leaks when using that i then found #1533 and reproduced #1614 that i confirmed it also happens with bytebuddy mock makers so i started the fix with help from @timvdlippe first of all i really didnt see a solution w/o tying mock lives with something and i think `mockitosession` is the most natural choice for the """"something"""" so technically its already not transparent to properly use inline mock makers because sessions are necessary to make it work while its optional to use subclass mock makersi also first tried to avoid `trackandcleanupmocks()` the difficulty actually comes from the fact mockitolisteners are threadlocal before this change and its a requirement to track mocks generated from other threads because [`failontimeout`][failontimeout] basically runs tests in different threads than the thread used to run before and after before this change user can have multiple `defaultmockitosession` as long as they are in different threads (`threadsrunalltestshalfmanualtest` also verifies that behavior) and not interfering with each other however if we convert `defaultmockitosession` to have """"thread global"""" influence `threadrunalltestshalfmanualtest` will fail because cross-threads mock cleanup will invalidate mocks created in tests running in a different threadi think i have a way (a bit hacky though) to make it work but i dont think its complication outweighs the new api (given that its already not transparent to users) it doesnt encourage clean tests in multi-threading scenario either imho however i can still put my thought here and let you decide if we should take it:- dont reject registration of global listeners if its from a different thread for the same type- only clean up mocks when the last `mocktracker` is unregisteredthen it basically treats the life of any `defaultmockitosession` as mock lives it doesnt allow user to precisely control mock lives but with some care users should still be able to avoid oom[failontimeout]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock() im not sure if the plugin way is still preferred over current change because for most dexmakers theyre still just implementing the basic `mockmaker` interface and nothing should break while they can choose to implement `inlinemockmaker` if clean up is necessary || just to be clear that im waiting for @mockitoguy s response on if we would like to go for that approach in exchange of removing trackandcleanupmocks() api just in case were waiting for each other and its going nowhere || as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is :+1: for me :smile:  || hey @ttanxu so you youre saying that the approach i suggested in a) wouldnt work? || > oh i already added `inlinemockmaker` interface so not all mock makers need to implement cleanupmock()great! ill review again this weekend || > as a sidenote: the refactoring with the new inlinemockmaker interface is ðŸ‘ for me ðŸ˜„@timvdlippe im with you its a good idea to have a separate interface and stay compatible || hey @mockitoguy  what you suggested could solve the same issue that is solved by `inlinemockmaker` in current pr (the mockmaker contract breakage)`trackandcleanupmocks()` was introduced for other reason but could use different tech to remove its necessity i explained the detail in previous comments (mostly because of the multi-thread implementation of [`failontimeout`][1] in junit)[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || @ttanxu thank you for explanation im looking into it || my comment is short but i put a lot of consideration into this given all arguments i agree that a new api is the best way before we ship it i want to bounce one more idea what if we tie mockmaker with mockitosession? when the session completes it tears down its mockmaker/cleans up all mocks we could use threadlocal thoughts? || correct me if im wrongit seems youre suggesting one `mockmaker` per thread the critical part of this approach is the mock map in the inline mock maker needs to be a `threadlocal` which means mocks wont look have handlers tied to them in threads other than the thread where they were created and thus wont appear to be a mock and method invocations on it might trigger exceptions thats not likely a compatible change to existing use cases because if [`failontimeout`][1] is used befores and afters are executed in a different thread than the test methodif we still only have one `mockmaker` across all threads then the structure is pretty much the same as current change except that instead of calling `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` we just tear down the entire `mockmaker` im not sure if this is better than calling `clearup()` it does sound like a viable solution w/o introduction to `inlinemockmaker` as we can just swap the instance of `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` the con is thats more of a systematic refactor than `inlinemockmaker#clearup()` approach and it reduces the cleanness of current code (we cant use final for `mockmaker` in `pluginregistry` anymore) btw this doesnt help avoid a new api `trackandclearupmocks()` in `mockitosession` ill leave this decision to you[1]: https://githubcom/junit-team/junit4/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/internal/runners/statements/failontimeoutjava#l120 || great points thank you for taking the time to explain why do we need to keep track of specific mocks? can we just clear all? || oh you say we dont have to save created mocks in a list in `mocktracker`? i guess we can just clear all mocks especially considering there cant be multiple mock-tracking sessions open at the same time mocks created before the session is opened may be leakedremoving `mocktracker` can simply this change a lot especially we dont need global listeners ill update the change || actually i recall that the thought of tracking specific mocks stemmed from the thought that usually mocks have different lives eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different lives it would be nice if we can keep mocks created in beforeclass for later reusecurrent impl is half baked because there can only be one tracking session but i want to keep `cleanup(object)` signature (or we can have `cleanup(object)` instead so that we can clean up everything if object array is `null`) for `inlinemockmaker` just in case we want to support the case abovewith that said ill change `cleanup(object)` to `cleanup(object)` and use `null` array for clean up everything || oh besides if we just want to clear everything it doesnt seem natural to me to add the api to mockitosession maybe we can add an api to mockito? || thank you for considering! i want us to strive for simplicity ill think about the new api for mockito (or mockitoframework)if we have a static method like """"mockitoframework()clearallmocks()"""" would it work for you? > eg mocks held by static variables created in beforeclass in before and in individual tests may need to have different livesdo we know legit use cases for """"static"""" mocks? it seems an anti-pattern || finally cleaned up all remains from previous change its a lot simpler now please take a looki can think of a case for static mocks where constructing a mock may be expensive and someone wants to reuse it across tests thats not an argument why static mocks have to be used though they can definitely reconstruct those mocks || reviewing || we are ready thank you @ttanxu and @timvdlippe for patience! this is the best pragmatic step to resolve the problem in the future perhaps we can avoid having the weak map of references in a first place@ttanxu i made some tweaks to tests documentation ive also renamed the method to """"clearmocks() -> clearinlinemocks()"""" for consistency take a look and see if youre ok with this let us know and ill merge this nice work with this change!@timvdlippe i did some cosmetic changes please review if you want thanks! || i will review this on monday in the office thanks for the polish! || > test user can safely call clearinlinemocks() and clearmock() even when mock maker is not a inline mock maker@ttanxu great point! || im making the final tweaks based on the code review and im merging || this is awesome thank you guys! iâ€™ll try this api on our codebase and samples iâ€™ve provided in original issues also â€”Â kudos for including tests reproducing the behavior iâ€™ve described ðŸ˜‰  || hi just to let you know i am using the new api already with v2282 and for me it was breaking the strict test with following exception:``` orgmockitoexceptionsmisusingnotamockexception: argument passed to mockitomockingdetails() should be a mock but is an instance of class cache$mockitomock$149288076!       at orgmockitointernalrunnersdefaultinternalrunner$1$2testfinished(defaultinternalrunnerjava:63) ```i had to move it to `@afterclass` to mitigate the problem || @s2131 you are not allowed to interact with mocks anymore after calling that api because all internal states of mocks are cleaned up after the api call that includes all delayed actions or interactions from other threadsunfortunately its never as easy as just calling that api || "";memory leak in mockito-inline calling method on mock with at least a mock as parameter;# summarywe found a memory leak with mockito-inline a short example is shown as below a more detailed example can be found at the end```javaclass bigclass {  void accept(smallclass small) {}}class smallclass {  void accept(bigclass big) {}}void leak() {  bigclass a  mockitomock(bigclassclass)  smallclass b  mockitomock(smallclassclass)  // remove any one of the 2 lines below will stop leaking  aaccept(b)  baccept(a)}```# analysislooking at the [memory dump][memdump] mock of `bigclass` and `smallclass` are held as a weak ref in a map of type `weakconcurrentmap$withinlinedexpunction` used to map the mock and its invocation handler when the mock can be reclaimed by gc the map will remove the record from itin the case with memory leak the mock instance of `bigclass` was held as a strong reference by `rawarguments` and `arguments` in [`invocationmatcher`][invocationmatcher]  as `invocation` in [`interceptedinvocation`][interceptedinvocation] as `invocationforstubbing` in [`invocationcontainerimpl`][invocationcontainerimpl] as `invocationcontainer` in [`mockhandlerimpl`][mockhandlerimpl] that eventually leads to a value in the `weakconcurrentmap` for `smallclass` similar thing happens to the mock instance of `smallclass` that creates a ring of reference and no mock can be reclaimed by gc because they are all referenced transitively by a value in the mapsimilar things can also happen for stubbed methods saved in `stubbed` in `invocationcontainerimpl`subclass mock makers dont suffer from it because there is no map from mock to handler -- its just a strong reference gc can handle non-accessible rings well but gc doesnt know the mock map purging semantic in inline mock makers# potential solutionunlike #1533 where converting `spiedinstance` to a weak reference may be an acceptable solution we cant convert arguments in stubbing method calls into weak references because there are stubbing calls with an object (or a mock) that doesnt have strong ref anywhere else than arguments in mockitotherefore i failed to see a solution thats transparent to callers the possible solution below is the one that i think has the least changethe possible solution is we can somehow reset the mock when their lives end which clears the stubbing records maybe we can tie their lives to a `mockitosession` we can track all mocks created after a session is created and reset them when the session is finished now we only have events for mock creation in the same thread we may need to expand that to include other threadswe may be able to set `spiedinstance` to `null` when their lives end which should also be able to fix #1532 and #1533 that would be a solution with least riskof course any solution thats transparent to callers is still more desirable# a detailed

the detailed explanation!> we may be able to set `spiedinstance` to `null` when their lives end which should also be able to fix #1532 and #1533 that would be a solution with least risksounds like the best plan forward do you mind opening a pr with regression test to get that fixed? || it seems to be rather hard to convert all listeners to listen to events from all threads due to current test setuphowever its pretty important to capture mocks from other threads to make this solution work because junit has failontimeout impl which basically runs each individual test case in its own thread that means we need start a session in each test case rather than in setup and teardown which is rather inconvenientill add a global listener that captures all mock events from all threads but disable the feature unless caller explicitly enables in session buildersit would be a hard refactor to make `threadsrunalltestshalfmanualtest` pass with this || actually we probably shouldnt refactor those tests since they probably represent part of current api but it should be just ok to stick to the plan in my previous comment || thanks! i added documentation about this as it was having a big impact on a project and was hard to find https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/wiki/whats-new-in-mockito-2#mockito-2250 || we just updated our testing dependencies to latest version and ran into this oom how is adding an @after-annotated function to 3000+ tests practical of which some already have their own implementation @after implementation? or maybe im missing something? || there was a lot of discussion about this feature in the corresponding pr: #1619 that should hopefully clear up why we were forced to implement it this way ðŸ˜¢  || got it so is there a way that you know of to invoke that for all tests without me going into every test and adding that code? maybe via some test listener or reflection? || you can write your own test runner that extends from the default mockito runner and implements the logicwe might actually consider that as part of the default mockito runner implementation do you mind opening a pr to start that discussion? it will mostly revolve around potential issues with multithreaded code || > we just updated our testing dependencies to latest version and ran into this oom> how is adding an @after-annotated function to 3000+ tests practical of which some

my understanding is that using mock in thenreturn is forbidden when it is a part of when as well but frankly i dont get why :-)```@testpublic void shouldmockmethodbutdoesnot() {    testinterface mock  mockitomock(testinterfaceclass)    when(mockgetobject())thenreturn(mockitomock(objectclass))    when(mockreturnsomething())thenreturn(new testinterfaceuser(mock))}static interface testinterface {    public testinterfaceuser returnsomething()    public object getobject()}static class testinterfaceuser {    object obj    public testinterfaceuser( testinterface t) {        thisobj  tgetobject()    }}```;""if you slightly change your code to the next form:``` java@testpublic void shouldmockmethodbutdoesnot() {    testinterface mock  mockitomock(testinterfaceclass)    when(mockgetobject())thenreturn(mockitomock(objectclass))    testinterfaceuser t  new testinterfaceuser(mock)    when(mockreturnsomething())thenreturn(t)}```it is working correctlyalternatively if you do next thing:``` java@testpublic void shouldmockmethodbutdoesnot() {    testinterface mock  mockitomock(testinterfaceclass)    when(mockgetobject())thenreturn(mockitomock(objectclass))    when(mockreturnsomething())thenreturn(new testinterfaceuser(mock))}static interface testinterface {    public testinterfaceuser returnsomething()    public object getobject()}static class testinterfaceuser {    testinterface obj    public testinterfaceuser( testinterface t) {        thisobj  t    }}```it also behave in expected wayyour problem is connected to the fact that in one place you are trying to register mock behaviour for selected method `when(mockreturnsomething())` - as a result mock is in state for registering answer  and then you are interacting with the same mock by invoking method `getobj()` as a result mock is moved from waiting for answer state to some other one without receiving answeri am not sure whether i explain it to you in enough clear way but i think that you should more or less catch it i think that provided workaround should be sufficient for youas far as i know there is no easy way to handle exactly the same cases described by you (but maybe i am wrong) || thanks alberskib for your reply i know how to build such a workaround :) what is more i was almost sure that """"incorrect state"""" is the reason why exception is thrown nothing new for me but the question is if it is a desired behavior or just a bug? in my opinion it is at least weird || > the question is if it is a desired behavior or just a bug?it is really good question but unfortunately i am not able to answer to iti think that @szczepiq or @bric3 will be able to answer it || hi @mplewkafor this kind of code it is expected ie a mock is being used while the other mock is not yet stubbedmock stubbing wasnt really designed to be _intertwined_ things are already complicated but when mocks call another while being stubbed it becomes very difficult to actually detect the correct arguments for the correct call in intertwined mocks i dont remember the details but if we relax this part it may blow in the wrong way for some other casesalso if you want i can give more precise detail on whats really going on in the snippet you provided || "";1;0;improve javadoc with links;"

i did the minimum to keep the patch small but a more complete change would: 1 move [objenesisinstantiator](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/instance/objenesisinstantiatorjava#l11) to a bytebuddy-like subpackage such as orgmockitointernalcreationinstanceobjenesis and 1 initialize [defaultinstantiatorprovider](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/2x/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/instance/defaultinstantiatorproviderjava#l13) so it uses the plugin api to define its defaultthat small re-org plus the new unit test should make it much more obvious what is core and what belongs in bytecode-based mockito implementations || > should i also objenesis references should be moved out of core mockito?lets put that in a follow up issue/pr and keep this pr small i want to get this patch in but want to have the regression test in here now that way if we do decide to do the follow up pr we can refactor safely || sounds good i should have the test done later today its a little more involved than nojunitdependenciestest because the default plugins are getting loaded ill see if a set of stub plugins can be substituted (may be useful for future tests) and if not update the tests classloader to not test the list of default plugin classes || test added its not perfect since defaultmockitoplugins has bytebuddy plugin names hardwired so classes that trigger that class loading needed to be removed to fully test plugin loading code wed have to make defaultmockitopluginsdefault_plugins settable so a set of plugin stub classes can be substituted this seems like a useful but bigger change that you likely want with this pr || i think this test is fine for now thanks for adding it! ||;objenesishelper references in mockmaker-independent code;a couple of references to orgobjenesis classes in code that is otherwise independent of bytecode-based mocks:src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/answers/clonesargumentsjavasrc/main/java/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/answers/throwsexceptionclassjavaboth of these classes use objenesishelpernewinstance(class) which differs from classnewinstance() in that no constructors are called is that necessary for these classes? if not then updating to classnewinstance() makes mockito fully platform-independent (at least for platforms that define a mockmaker) if it is necessary can this call be moved into mockmaker?im happy to make the changes once the team decides on the best approach;im with youthe interactions with objenesis should be better isolated mockmaker might be a reasonable idea technically creating instances of things is not mockmakers responsibility so perhaps there is a better way? a different extension point? check out orgmockitoplugins package || it looks like you already did most of the work! the orgmockitointernalcreationinstance package defines instantiator with the correct method so it looks like all thats to be done to make this cross-platform is to move instantiator to orgmockitoplugins and update instantiatorprovider to check for a plugin before assigning a objenesisinstantiator to instantiatorproviderinstanceif youre comfortable with that approach ill make the changes and submit a pull request || any updates on this?

|| i cant promise to look at it swiftly ive never run an android emulator before itll take me a while to get set upin the meantime @matejdro  if you could post the stack trace of the error that would help i might be able to get a clue without seeing up the whole environment || here you go:[stacktracetxt](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/files/3216729/stacktracetxt) || thankslooks like youve got some funky classloader in there doing something odd ill try and look more closely later possibly later in the weekend || ive had a quick look and i havent been able to get the emulator running easily to reproduce it myself however having had a closer look at the stack trace i suspect that it is some kind of feature in the test harness (perhaps in androidjunitrunner) that is supposed to detect and warn when your code tries to load classes that it cant find on its classpath attempting to load the opentest4j class is perfectly normal behaviour for this version of mockito though and the attempt is surrounded by a <tt>catch()</tt> which ordinarily would catch any error thrownas a workaround you could try putting opentest4j on your classpath you might lose the visual diff in case of failure though || here is my guess on what happens:exceptions catching for missing classes only [surrounds factory creation not the actual exception creation](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/28012a49cb1b1aab1b957ac5e7507dd8b807a47e/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/junit/exceptionfactoryjava#l23) it is possible that desktop jvm verifies all methods on class creation but androids runtime does not and thus no exception is thrown there instead androids runtime throws missing class exception when `create()` method is executed for the first time which does not have`try/catch` around it || i thought about your suggestion but i dont think it fits with the stack trace that you provided in the stack trace its clear that the line its complaining about is line 24 in the static initializer for `exceptionfactory` when the factory implementation is actually created:at orgmockitointernaljunitexceptionfactory<clinit>(exceptionfactoryjava:24)i expect a `classnotfounderror` to get thrown here when opentest4j is not on the class path what is not expected is that this isnt caught by the surrounding `catch(throwable)` statement which is why i think the android test framework is doing something funkyif what youre suggesting were true id expect line 27 to appear at the top of the stack trace but it doesnt appear at all according to the stack trace it is failing before `create()` is even called this scenario would also be contrary to the jvm spec (which from memory specifies that all the classs linkages should be resolved when the class is loaded and not when a method is executed)one way to test this would be to package up a junit test and deploy it as an apk into the emulator and run it directly rather than as part of an instrumentation test if you want to give that a try and let me know how you go we can analyse the result || ok @matejdro  i still havent been able to get the android studio stuff working but based on the above educated guess ive made a change that might do the trick you can find this change under branch `1716-opentest4j-under-android` in my fork of mockito (https://githubcom/kriegfrj/mockito) if you could download build and install this and give it a try and let me know if it fixes your problem that would be much appreciatedif it does fix your problem ill create a pr from this branch so that @timvdlippe  or @mockitoguy can merge it if not i guess ill go back to the drawing board || sorry for the delay any tips on how to build `mockito-android`? running `gradlew build` only procudes `mockito-core` and i cannot find a way to switch it to androidps: there appear to be checkstyle errors in the branch (i had to disable checkstyle to even get core to build) || never mind figured it out (android project is in the `subprojects` folder) it appears that using your branch fixes the issue i no longer get the crash || thanks for verifying @matejdro i have created a pr for this issue now (#1723)thank you so much for your help - i was dreading having to go through the process of getting the android emulator working! im sure it would have been fun to try but (like most people) im a bit time poor || i am also having this issue i was running v300 but switching back to 2250 fixed it  || > i am also having this issue i was running v300 but switching back to 2250 fixed itsorry @johnmahlon the fix for this was supposed to get merged into 30 but i dropped the ball hopefully it will get merged soonin the meantime as a workaround if you need mockito >2250 then you should be able to run it with any version of mockito if you just put `orgopentest4j` on your runtime classpath || @kriegfrj no problem our app isnâ€™t production yet so using 225 is definitely fine for now  ||;1;0;change implementation of exceptionfactory to explicitly test for the presence of dependent classes rather thandepend on the implicit classloading behaviour this is necessary as android classloading behaviour is slightly different fixes #1716changed to use lambdas now that codebase is on java 18;

are we sharing the test instance (and thus sharing mocks suts?) || you are welcome :-) i dont know details about junits parallelization || > how does the junit5 parallel execution work? are we sharing the test instance (and thus sharing mocks suts?)by default not and the user must be very explicit to enable sharing of the same test class instance with parallel execution enabled ie even if parallel execution mode is enabled by default and a test class is annotated with `lifecycleper_class` its tests will still be executed sequentially _unless_ it is also annotated with `@execution(concurrent)`: https://junitorg/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-executioni also bumped into this issue in our codebase with some tests using `mockitoextension` failing in parallel mode and some working fine could not spot anything particularly special about the failing ones || i can confirm that the problem exists i also have tests using mockitoextension and they fail in a non-deterministic way randomly only if junit5 parralelization is used || scenario:1 junit 5 creates a single `classextensioncontext `for a multithreaded test but each thread becomes an instance of the test class2 each thread will come into `postprocesstestinstance `where they put their test instance in the same `classextensioncontextgetstore(mockito)` map with the same key (`test_instance`)3 each thread then will get into `beforeeach` they get a thread unique `methodextensioncontext` but each of them contain the same instance of `classextensioncontext` then they fetch the the last updated `test_instance `from the parent `classextensioncontext `inside the `collectparenttestinstances `method each thread gets quasi a random test instance depending on the fact which thread was before inside the `postprocesstestinstance `method then they prepare their broken session inside the store of the current `methodextensioncontext `with a random test instance includedthat is the explanation i am thinking about how to solve thisit is not 100% clear to me why the parent context test instance is included i will check how this scenario looks like in a singlethreaded environment || this is really painful to debug but im making progress what i found out is that """"collectparenttestinstances()"""" is non-deterministic:```thread[16] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@2bf588f6]thread[13] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@240da1f5 orgmockitoanothertest@6646267a]thread[17] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@6646267a]thread[14] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@f9b9d48]```notice that anothertest@6646267a is processed twice effectively initmocks() is called twice for that test instance clearing up the invocationsdo you have an idea how to fix collectparenttestinstances()? || perhaps we drop the collectparenttestinstances() complexity and just keep the test instances in static threadlocal object in the extension postprocesstestinstance() feeds the thread local state beforeeach() consumes it i dont know enough about the """"context store"""" api though || i have a plan how to fix it first we need to upgrade junit-jupiter (#1788) || @mockitoguy i am not sure why you have closed the issue in the attached commit i cannot see the fix for the problemcontext store api seems to be pretty simple to me it is just a map in the context to store some information the real question is what is this kind of context hierarchy used for in junit 5 and how it behaves in case of nested tests or multithreaded tests or even in multithreaded nested tests i guess it could have some interesting beahaviour in case of parameterized (dynamic) tests probably it would be a good idea simply to ask the junit developers about this issue maybe they could provide some valuable feedback || pr #1789 fixes the problem this ticket got closed by accident thanks for looking into it! || looking forward to the next release!i would like to confirm the bug is gone but i dont know how to do it in https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630can someone add a pr to https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630 using mockito 3012 (at least)?

are we sharing the test instance (and thus sharing mocks suts?) || you are welcome :-) i dont know details about junits parallelization || > how does the junit5 parallel execution work? are we sharing the test instance (and thus sharing mocks suts?)by default not and the user must be very explicit to enable sharing of the same test class instance with parallel execution enabled ie even if parallel execution mode is enabled by default and a test class is annotated with `lifecycleper_class` its tests will still be executed sequentially _unless_ it is also annotated with `@execution(concurrent)`: https://junitorg/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-executioni also bumped into this issue in our codebase with some tests using `mockitoextension` failing in parallel mode and some working fine could not spot anything particularly special about the failing ones || i can confirm that the problem exists i also have tests using mockitoextension and they fail in a non-deterministic way randomly only if junit5 parralelization is used || scenario:1 junit 5 creates a single `classextensioncontext `for a multithreaded test but each thread becomes an instance of the test class2 each thread will come into `postprocesstestinstance `where they put their test instance in the same `classextensioncontextgetstore(mockito)` map with the same key (`test_instance`)3 each thread then will get into `beforeeach` they get a thread unique `methodextensioncontext` but each of them contain the same instance of `classextensioncontext` then they fetch the the last updated `test_instance `from the parent `classextensioncontext `inside the `collectparenttestinstances `method each thread gets quasi a random test instance depending on the fact which thread was before inside the `postprocesstestinstance `method then they prepare their broken session inside the store of the current `methodextensioncontext `with a random test instance includedthat is the explanation i am thinking about how to solve thisit is not 100% clear to me why the parent context test instance is included i will check how this scenario looks like in a singlethreaded environment || this is really painful to debug but im making progress what i found out is that """"collectparenttestinstances()"""" is non-deterministic:```thread[16] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@2bf588f6]thread[13] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@240da1f5 orgmockitoanothertest@6646267a]thread[17] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@6646267a]thread[14] collectparenttestinstances() - returns: [orgmockitoanothertest@f9b9d48]```notice that anothertest@6646267a is processed twice effectively initmocks() is called twice for that test instance clearing up the invocationsdo you have an idea how to fix collectparenttestinstances()? || perhaps we drop the collectparenttestinstances() complexity and just keep the test instances in static threadlocal object in the extension postprocesstestinstance() feeds the thread local state beforeeach() consumes it i dont know enough about the """"context store"""" api though || i have a plan how to fix it first we need to upgrade junit-jupiter (#1788) || @mockitoguy i am not sure why you have closed the issue in the attached commit i cannot see the fix for the problemcontext store api seems to be pretty simple to me it is just a map in the context to store some information the real question is what is this kind of context hierarchy used for in junit 5 and how it behaves in case of nested tests or multithreaded tests or even in multithreaded nested tests i guess it could have some interesting beahaviour in case of parameterized (dynamic) tests probably it would be a good idea simply to ask the junit developers about this issue maybe they could provide some valuable feedback || pr #1789 fixes the problem this ticket got closed by accident thanks for looking into it! || looking forward to the next release!i would like to confirm the bug is gone but i dont know how to do it in https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630can someone add a pr to https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630 using mockito 3012 (at least)?  || release have been already published see https://bintraycom/mockito/maven/mockito-development || @mockitoguy when will this fix be released to maven central? || i will publish a release today || i updated https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630 - seems to work without problems using mockito v310 thanks a lot!i will delete https://githubcom/schultemarkus/mockitobug1630 within a few weeks || publish to maven central failed yet again i will need to contact sonatype again || (although https://repo1mavenorg/maven2/org/mockito/mockito-core/310/ does exist so it might just work) || i can confirm that the solution of 310 version works for all of the tests in my project still i dont understand how junit works but it is fine now since the tests workthanks for your fast fix & release! || "";1;0;cleanup traversal of parent contexts;"

(i dont object reworking the artifacts - i want understanding for me and others :)) || > can you elaborate the problem? is it a google mono-repo use case? (i dont object reworking the artifacts - i want understanding for me and others :))this is for every repository that includes third_party code that we need to have the original source code for security analyses that includes the mono repository as well as some other repositories that we havesince the hamcrest api is not type-safe (as it requires casting with `object` vs `t` as argument type) we would like to move away from unsafe type casts the `argumentmatcher` interface does not inherit that problem but the older hamcrest api doesby having the hamcrest-compatible api in the mockito artifact users can still use mockito in combination with the hamcrest apii would personally say that while the hamcrest api was originally useful for defining reusable matchers the lack of type-safety does more harm than good i have received good responses when i finished the migration of the `argumentmatcher` to be typed and it already caught bugs in our tests i think we should promote the type-safe `argumentmatcher` and thus deprecate the old api but happy to disagree on that part and leave hamcrest compatibility in for example a separate artifact || > that we need to have the original source code for security analysesso the problem is that in addition to mockito source you have to pull in hamcrest source for the analysis? (i still dont feel i fully understand this use case)> by having the hamcrest-compatible api in the mockito artifact users can still use mockito in combination with the hamcrest apithats a fair argument> leave hamcrest compatibility in for example a separate artifactto keep backwards compatibility we would need """"mockito-core"""" -> """"mockito-hamcrest"""" are you thinking of reversing the dependency in future major version? || revert of this pr is in https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/commit/ad2f3526a347f37dd00c53ee664c5cd9f3738814 || > so the problem is that in addition to mockito source you have to pull in hamcrest source for the analysis?

@mockito/developers ? || revert in progress: https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1878 || "";1;0;improved the test coverage- made the tests less complicated- added assertions on the _count_ of unnecessary stubbings- made the exception message more informative;"

also im curious what is driving this feature - do you have tests at work that need it or was there a user request?i dont object the feature id like to understand better why we need this thanks! || please see the `junittestruleintegrateswithrulechaintest` that shows how it can be used with `rulechain` the test code will not compile if you omit the `this` as `mockitorule` inherits from `methodrule` whereas `rulechain` needs a `testrule` in other words if mockito does not expose a subclass from `testrule` those users can not use mockito in combination with `rulechain` as it will not compile || the background for this change is that we are moving google to use the open source rule rather than our internal one during that migration we discovered that we could not migrate to the rule if it was used in combination with a subset of the junit features one of which is the `@rulechain` this pr would fix the integration and allow google (as well as other users) to use the mockito rule in combination with all junit features || > the background ()thank you! this is a very valuable information that helps understanding why we need this feature! || @mockitoguy i am waiting for a final review from the junit maintainers at google but then i would like to merge this pr i assume based on https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1858#issuecomment-574292294 that you are a-okay?

stubbing can be overridden: for example common stubbing can go to fixture setup but the test methods can override it please note that overridding stubbing is a potential code smell that points out too much stubbingbut by simply making a copy of a stub by duplicating its line (or more realistically returning a different value in the second stub) an `unnecessarystubbingexception` is thrown

https://githubcom/codearte/catch-exception is currently active or what system should be used instead to test exceptions in bdd style?i remember i saw it at some point last year on gc at their old home : https://codegooglecom/p/catch-exception/ but it seem they have changed their plan i didnt even know they migrated to gh actually i prefer assertj for assertions with version 200 theres nifty api on that matter> > in the mean time the only sensible thing to do would be to create a class that can serve as an api dispatcher> > what do you mean by in the meantime?i mean that until mockito team reach consensus on this api change this issue is on hold> what is the long-term solution to cleanly test mocks exceptions and return values in bdd style?its probably a question of taste but i dont see any clarity problem if not using _static imports_ note that the little pseudo code is just random ideas but this can of course be renamed according to your taste maybe asking on the mockito mailing list can help on that matterspock is indeed a great tool i dont know they integrate stuff still if you have feedback im interested || im a guy from catch-exception team :) i would recommend to use `bddassertionsthen` instead of `bddcatchexceptionthen` this combo works fine for java6 and java7 `bddcatchexceptionthen` is here only for compatibility with java8<del>java8 has some problem with generics (bug? or feature) and do not compile i would recommend using assertj `bddassertionsthenthrownby` alone (without catch-exception)</del>issue with java8 is fixed in latest catch-exception `bddcatchexceptionthen` is deprecated now use `bddassertionsthen` instead || ok great :) i use java 8 and your solution works so things are settled regarding catch-exception by using the assertj api (`bddassertionsthen()`)now the solution on mockito side should imho be the same: use the assertj api (a nifty api as you mentioned) otherwise we are stuck with using `verify()` instead of `then()should()` to check mock interactions and thus cannot use bdd stylei also tested spock 10 (spock-core + spock-spring) to write unit tests and spring integration tests (including with `mockmvc` and transactions) and i can recommend it so far as it covers everything i asked here and much more with a clean bdd style just need some patience to learn groovy and some things which are approached in a different way (eg """"mocking and stubbing of the same method call has to happen in the same interaction"""" cfr http://spockframeworkgithubio/spock/docs/10/interaction_based_testinghtml) || ok thanks for the feedback @mariuszs and thanks for the feedback on spock too :)> now the solution on mockito side should imho be the same: use the assertj apii dont follow you there the only possible thing to do is to add other _tactical_ aliases @szczepiq and i have mixed feelings about that thats why i proposed to create a custom _dispatch_ api with those tactical aliases eg``` javathen(bike)contains(a_handlebar)thena(person)should(times(2))ride(bike)``` || from my users endpoint i see that catch-exception has been able to resolve this issue of conflicting `then()`s by checking caught exceptions through the assertj api so all im saying is that mockito should imho do the same so that the only `then()` that the user should call would be assertjs (which makes sense it _is_ an assertion api) || indeed but assertj has nothing to do with mocks )its not the role of assertj to know mockito internals to check the interactions also current mockito matchers api is based on hamcrest and for several reason upgrading hamcrest has proven to be a difficult task we now even want to remove the dependency on external framework as much as possible including hamcrest || "";1;0;fixes #1898 : return mock name from tostring method for deep stub mocks;"

of this is that reporterargumentsaredifferent() can return-  an orgmockitoexceptionsverificationopentest4jargumentsaredifferent a subclass of orgopentest4jassertionfailederror- an orgmockitoexceptionsverificationjunitargumentsaredifferent a subclass of junitframeworkcomparisonfailureaccording to whether opentest or junit is available in the classpath neither of these crucially extends mockitoassertionerror hence the exception is not caught in descriptionverify and wrapped in a mockitoassertionerror with the description that would only happen if neither opentest nor junit were in the classpathi think the catch block there should also catch these other exceptions and handle them in a similar way to include the description text || its extending those because of tooling and ide support i believe in intellij idea for example this error is displayed really nice you can see and compare the differences on the arguments || the various argumentsaredifferent exceptions come from orgmockitointernaljunitexceptionfactory which deals solely with that condition the header comment of mockitoassertionerror suggests it should be the base of all verification errors triggered by verify() methods so maybe some refactoring is required i dont know enough to say whether the solution is to handle the exceptions which are actually being thrown or change to throw subclasses of mockitoassertionerror which would then fix the issue || created a pr with a possible solution: https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1949 || "";1;0;fixes #1712 : fix formatting;"

|| great feedback thats the first thing to figure out when working on this ticket :) || the way i saw mocking of static methods for myself was to only mock calls to static methods that happen within a mock this would be useful for example for implementing spies in a situation like:```javaclass foo {  string bar() { return utilmakestring() }}```with mockito i would like to see something like:```javafoo foo  spy(new foo())doreturn(""""foo"""")when(foo)invokesstatic(utilclass)makestring()assertthat(foobar())isequalto(""""foo"""")```what do you think? as for a hack i am missing a component in byte buddy which i was supposed to write for a customer at some point what did however not pull through i am not currently in a position to spend so much time to build this component due to my personal situation but please prototype away i think the api and spec work is crucial to make this a success || great feedback! thank you rafael for sharing your thoughtsis the component you mentioned a lot of work in bytebuddy? is this something that we can ask the community to help out or youre the best person to take on?id rather see more robust api but your api idea is certainly workable mocking statics should be rare and our api should be optimized for common use cases and not edge/rare cases we can always iterate based on feedback :)heres my preference as of today:```java//setupmockstatic(utilclass)//thendoanswer()when(() -> utilfoo())when(utilfoo())thenreturn(""""foo"""")verify(() -> utilfoo())verify(never() () -> utilfoo())```if we choose to support mocking static methods id rather offer api that is robust enough to support all kinds of use cases i like when tools are separated from policies and are opinionated but not dogmatic :) if we think that mocking static is disgusting we can ship it in a different jar called """"mockito-for-crappy-code"""" loosely following @timvdlippe ideathe main use cases for mocking statics i see are: - legacy code (i really really want to write a unit test but i dont dare to change some ancient ugly code) - dealing with some awkward static 3rd party apis this scenario is currently workable by developing some injectable api layer on top of 3rd party statics however the workaround could be cumbersome and can spoil the clarity of codebasewithout addressing above 2 use cases developers around the world will be looking for help in tools like powermockito and suchthe biggest downside of offering static mocking is making it too easy to test crappy procedural code full of static methods we would remove a motivation to refactor the code into clean oo / di || should we also send out a tweet to gather some community insights? || if this feature uses the java instrumentation api it will not work on android devices so it might confuse android developersif so i think it should not be integrated into the `mockito-core` artifact || i came across this issue by chance (i was just curious to know what you were planning for mockito 3) but id like to share my experiences of working with static method mockingi used to work on several large codebases that made extensive use of static methods and used powermock (and powermockito) heavily for testing my main memories of that time were that the tests were really slow to run (in some cases tests that use powermock were literally ten times slower than those that didnt) and that we ultimately had to remove all usages of powermock because it wasnt compatible with newer versions of java i also recall there being incompatibilities with some libraries were using that required special setup in the tests to make them pass although i no longer remember the details of thati can understand concerns about promoting bad code but as a mockito user id be more worried about the impact on performance and robustness not all of the code we were using powermock for was legacy some of it was new code written by an inexperienced team (of which i was part of) and knowing that mockito devs disapproved of our design patterns probably wouldnt have made any differencethis was a few years ago now and techniques for mocking static methods may have improved significantly since then if you think theres a performant and robust way to implement this feature then id welcome it (even though id hope i never have to use it) || really good feedback thank you guys i helps us make good decisions about the features/api we plan || in my opinion in general testing static methods is a bad idea and it would be better to refactor the code however sometimes its something that is needed for instance testing a default method `given()` in [mockito-java8 interface](https://githubcom/szpak/mockito-java8/blob/master/src/main/java/info/solidsoft/mockito/java8/api/withbddmockitojava#l68) delegating to a static method in `bddmockitogiven()` the easiest solution i see is to generate in runtime a list of static methods in `bddmockito` and execute parameterized test for every of them verifying that a corresponding method in `withbddmockito` interface delegates to it with proper parameters in that case static method mocking would be beneficial maybe i will wait for powermockito for mockito v2 to test mockito itselfalternatively i would need to play with aop and load-time weaving code generation in runtime or some other not very pleasant to use technique (unless you have some good ideas how to do it easier) || @szpak thank you for the feedback! interesting use casei think we all agree that mocking statics is a bad practice and an anti-pattern in general the question is whether we enforce the """"no mocking statics"""" policy (eg not offer the feature in the tool) or let the user decide to enforce it or not (eg offer the feature) || please consider the legacy code issue sometimes you dont have any choice enforcing or not a practice shouldnt be the decision of a framework but of the teamalso for now were using powermock as a workaround for this need but its not compliant with the last versions of mockito were blocked with 19x version of mockitoits another good reason to get this feature: limit dependencieswe already need all these libraries to get decent unit test in pure java world:junitjunitparams as junit parametrized are awfullassertj for expressive and clear assertionsmockito  and powermockand i shouldnt mention other peripheral libraries:dbunitspringdbunitjbehave jgiven for bdd style  then you can write all your testing stuf in groovy and you only need  spockplease! let user choose othewise why did you provide private method mocking in the recent versions athough its considered as a """"bad"""" practice for tdd purists ? finally thanks for your great work mockito is really a nice framework  || mocking static methods is a different use case maybe that means it should be a different tool answer the following questions (to yourself):- do you want to support a double tool in the long term? - does it use the same set of dependencies and only those? - does mocking static methods fall nicely into the current design?if you answer all 3 with """"yes"""" then go ahead if at least one is a """"no"""" consider the alternatives:- build a mockito extension- build a new tool and call it mackarita- leave the other tool to someone elsejust my two cents || i agree with most of you and think that mocking static methods is not a good ideaif some method uses static method provided by legacy library/framework then it can be easily wrapped in object and provided as mockable dependency its not perfect solution but is educational - shows developers that writing too complex static util methods hurts and makes code hard to test if mockito had such feature many of developers would consider it as acceptable practise and produce bad codeanother issue is parallel tests execution in my current project we used to use powermockito to mock static methods and after some time our tests started to fail because of concurrency issues:1 thread a mocked static method xy and stopped2 thread b mocked static method xy and stopped3 thread a was awaken and run test - it failed because thread b overwritten static methods behaviour expected in test run by awe ended up with wrapping static methods in injectable objects and removed powermockito from project dependencies || i had asked about this at some point in the past and was told it was being considered glad to see thats actually happeningin my opinion support for mocking static methods is a good idea for the simple reason that the standard java classes that ship with the jre have tons of static methods consider the nio2 api as an example if you want to read a file using that api you might do something like:```javafilesreadalllines(pathsget(""""myfile""""))```now is there a way to test this without mocking static methods? obviously yes you could make a ifiles interface and then make a jrefilesimpl that passes the calls through to the static methods but thats a bunch of extra effort it adds complexity to your code and obscures the methods that are actually being called in my opinion i shouldnt need to do that to test my codes ability to properly read some fileso +1 for the ability to mock static methods || > now is there a way to test this without mocking static methods?well in my opinion file name/path from your example is good candidate for passing it to method/setter/constructor instead of hardcoding it and you can just create test file in filesystem such java api methods are considered as simple and reliable and there is no need to mock them like you wouldnt mock `javautillist` if your method operated on data from given list you would just create actual list with test data || there are at least 2 problems with that argument: a) you cant test behavior when exceptions occur and b) you cant test behavior if the path is for a different os i realize the latter is an esoteric use case but i actually am working on a project that is developed on windows but runs exclusively on linux || i think the recurring theme right now is: either you are pro or you are strictly against it personally i am for clean tests and therefore consider static mocking very bad practice however our users apparently have usecases that require (intrusive?) solutions such as powermock given that these users opt for such solutions signals that the other solution would be no tests at all and that is probably what we would never wantgiven that solutions like powermock are built not only on mockito but also other libraries they can not be easily updated like mockito can this incentives mockito to solve static mocking if users opt-in for iteven though i inherently disagree with static mocking i think it is only fair that we as mockito developers offer users the option to opt-in a less intrusive and upgrade-compatible solution therefore i would vouch for a different artifact (probably called `mockito-legacy`) which offers static mocking this should signal our users that this is for legacy purposes and should be strictly discouraged but at least gives them a way out this particular solution would tick off all points of @jlinkin the end no matter which outcome there will always be disappointed developers we will not be able to find a golden solution for this particular problem and i am fairly convinced it will never happen eitherwe can always try it out with the new artifact and discontinue it later if it is significantly misusedone sidenote: putting everything in a new artifact would scatter the mockito ecosystem we should probably find a better solution for this potentially in mockito 3 || i disagree with @timvdlippe  i dont believe that in an open source world you can """"try it out with the new artifact and discontinue it later if it is significantly misused"""" once its there in the library users will require it to be there youll have to support that feature etc either its there or not not often can you easily deprecate sth and roll it back afterwards typically it requires a couple of release cycles@timvdlippe youre mentioning this """" however our users apparently have usecases that require (intrusive?) solutions such as powermock"""" i have a comment on that as an exercise from time to time im trying to answer powermock questions on stackoverflow typically someone says that theres a static method somewhere that theyre calling and it does some logic that they want to stub the question i often ask to those people is """"why are you doing this?"""" would you really want to stub a call to `stringutils` ? another frequent problem is that the design is flawed and thats why one is looking for hacks (eg http://stackoverflowcom/questions/37059406/how-can-i-get-powermock-to-return-the-expected-value-from-a-static-method/37066436#37066436  http://stackoverflowcom/questions/37052069/program-termination-during-quartz-scheduler-verification-using-power-mockito/37066521#37066521  http://stackoverflowcom/questions/31840964/powermock-private-method-with-null-pointer-exception/37066400#37066400 or http://stackoverflowcom/questions/32195928/getting-powermockito-to-mock-a-static-method-on-an-interface/32537392#32537392)thats why i fully agree with @karollewandowski  """"every problem can be solved with a layer of abstraction"""" ) you cant mock a static method? ok then wrap it in a class which you can stub is it wrong? quite the contrary rarely should you call static methods directly and if you do most likely these are utils that you dont want to stub you should encapsulate the logic of a static method in an object that makes business sense to use itsumming it up giving people a tool to stub static methods is making them even easier to write bad code instead of thinking of how to fix the design theyll be able to make the design even worse  || @timvdlippe just one thing: if you create a new artifact like """"mockito-legacy"""" communicate clearly if youre planning to support it mid/long-term or if its just an experiment some people are willing to experiment together with you others will be pissed off when you quit support after they have heavily used it || @rdicroce i completely disagree with this statement:> now is there a way to test this without mocking static methods? obviously yes you could make a ifiles interface and then make a jrefilesimpl that passes the calls through to the static methods but thats a bunch of extra effort it adds complexity to your code and obscures the methods that are actually being called in my opinion i shouldnt need to do that to test my codes ability to properly read some fileyoure design is wrong if you had ```filesreadalllines(pathsget(myfilepath))```you could via a constructor inject `myfilepath` to point to your test resources you dont even need to create any additional classes || the android community would like mock static methods well at least mewhy? : the android sdk provides many static utility methods with classes like textutils the downside is that there implementation is only provided on the device or emulator when users run unit-test on there local machine they will get the famous """"method not mocked"""" exception> the androidjar file that is used to run unit tests does not contain any actual code - that is provided by the android system image on real devices instead all methods throw exceptions (by default) this is to make sure your unit tests only test your code and do not depend on any particular behaviour of the android platform (that you have not explicitly mocked eg using mockito) they are many workarounds for this issue like powermock or roboelectric roboelectric is a great testing framework but it is damn slow and maintainance intensiv powermock is not stable state to be used with mockito 2 so i think at least android users will love this feature   || @christianschwarz i do not agree using android static utils or android framework in your business logic is a bad smell well structured android app do not need mocking static methods nor roboelectric calls to android framework must be abstracted and current mockito implementation helps to enforce that if you want to test view layer then go with instrumentation tests and espresso || @dbacinski i am not an expert on android so bear with me please :) adding extra layer introduces more method calls which can be problematic on large apps that hit dex method limit right?

faced with """"evil"""" static methods (hello `singletongetinstance()`) to handle these evil cases mockito can do its part and support the poor devs among us who have to deal with it i wouldnt blame mockito if devs start to introduce the """"evils""""  to there code base mockito is a mocking framework not a good style enforcement tool thats the task for the team and/or lead developer || @christianschwarz > static methods are are """"good"""" when they dont depend on a state / access a static member and thus have the same result on every calltrue there are even some schools in which all private methods should be static dont depend on anything apart arguments dont change the state of any object and dont do anything beside computing the result so theyre functions just like sin(angle) is: the angle isnt changed and sin is only the result of the angle always the same (provided the geometry is always the same -) )i find this functional style of programming very good but in fact it has rather not much to do with statics as such imho sometimes its better to tell newbies """"dont use statics couse theyre generally bad"""" its a kind of """"lie for children"""" || unfortunately as history has shown multiple times when developers see a tool and its use cases they do not always understand the impact and weight of its features they consider all features equal and do not understand that some of them should only be used as a last resortthe canonical example in the java world is the abuse of java introspection/reflection and aop for even trivial scenarios even outside the java world we see the misuse of advanced features by developers who use them """"simply because they are there"""" if we are to go forward with this (and i am strongly against this as i considered a major advantage of mockito the fact that it did not allow testing of static methods) i would suggest the following:- create a """"mockito-legacy"""" artifact/extension/add-on - require a configuration file option for mockito to actually enable this add-on- print in the log file when the test runs a huge warning (similar to what maven does when you dont define a version) that using this add-on is an anti-pattern and a code-smell- provide a link to the user that has a page with common refactoring scenarios that show how we can get rid of static methodsmaybe i am missing something but i really would like some examples on how legacy code cannot be refactored to remove the static dependency unless of course you cannot change the code at all which for me makes the creation of unit tests questionable (because if a unit test fails what are you going to do then?) || @kkapelon: i also wish all java code was pure oo design and that everyone actually knows what that means -) i hope such a huge warning """"youre doing it wrong"""" could educate and maybe convert a few folks> maybe i am missing something but i really would like some examples on how legacy code cannot be refactored to remove the static dependencyits not about the code itself ive seen big name companies enforcing policies in which before bugfixing the case has to be replicated in tests (kinda tdd they claim sometimes) then once the test fails just like the ticket describes the support team is allowed to change the code to make it pass (and sadly usually minimum changes) its rather difficult to make a test to cover statics if your testing tool set doesnt allow that chicken and egg problemits like all these the daily wtf stories in which """"dont change it it aint broke couse it works!"""" so the code is like java 14 || this would be great! we could finally stop bikeshedding """"static is *eeevil*"""" because not testable || > we could finally stop bikeshedding """"static is eeevil"""" because not testablewell imho static is eeevil in many cases not only because not testable :-d || the mocking framework shouldnt restrict the design options - its just not the job of a mocking framework! ive seen a lot of code polluted with mocking-only interfaces and there are a lot of cases where a simple static method is a perfect design decision `final` is also rarely used because mocking frameworks (besides the great [jmockit](http://jmockitorg/)) have trouble with it || dont do it!  powermockito exists for those cases where you absolutely need to mock static methods  right now mockito conforms to the commonly held opinion that static is for methods that are testable without mocks (think: stringutils)  static for other stuff should be discouraged (there are exceptions obviously) - in those situations encapsulating the static calls in a protected @visiblefortesting method should suffice for unit testing and for those other """"legacy or not"""" situations theres always powermockito   || @trumpetx i just wanted to note that the reason we are investigating this change is that some companies are in the legacy code situation where adopting powermockito would be too disruptive therefore these companies would be unable to test their classes even if they could adopt powermockito the tests become significantly more difficult to understand just to be able to test their legacy codethe question is: should we as mockito give the opt-in for these situations as other options are too invasive? i think every mockito core developer agrees that static mocking is bad and should not be done but sadly we can not dictate what the industry does or has to deal withjust wanted to give perspective on why we are opening this issue || @timvdlippe  i cant see how powermockito would be disruptive for tests (certainly no more disruptive than adding mockitostaticwhatever)additionally too difficult to understand?  seriously?  if someone has static mocks in their tests and theyre too difficult to understand they probably need to find a new career  im not saying this to be mean spirited or whatnot but it sounds like youre just making reasons to adopt this change || also for reference i cross-posted this issue on reddit and there some other arguments/viewpoints posted there: https://wwwredditcom/r/java/comments/64pdk1/mockito_discussion_on_introduction_of_mocking/ || @timvdlippe thanks for your link the recent posts have led me to anotherhttp://mvnrepositorycom/artifact/orgpowermock/powermock-api-mockito/usagesim just wondering why so many of them || i havent had experience with bytebuddy but id be willing to give it a shot as far as names how do we feel about `mockito-gore` to really indicate you need a strong reason to use this jar? || just a few more words from me maybe last ones -)theres a method in mockito:`orgmockitomatchers#isnull(javalangclass<t>)`isnt null considered to be """"the billion dollar mistake""""? shouldnt the programmers all around the world be educated that passing a null reference (instead of a `javautiloptional`) is a very bad practice?maybe this `isnull` method should be deprecated and eventually removed in future versions?ive seen a lot of code being polluted by `if (reference  null)` and `catch (nullpointerexception e)` more than by """"incorrect use of statics"""" (but ymmv)if supporting statics is going to create such bad habits among programmers and mockito is meant to be a forced education then i guess support for nulls should be removed in future versions and people should write wrappers to handle nulls from their legacy code as null is worse habit imho -)unless mockito is meant to be a testing/mocking framework not forced education coursethank you || i would like to add some comments from my own experience i completely understand the people that are saying to add an abstraction to the static methods that you are invoking however in a legacy code that is expensive and requires a lot of effort additionally there are frameworks like [gwt](http://wwwgwtprojectorg/) that support polymorphism but not like you would think one needs to call a static method that will do the creation of the object on runtime and runtime there is javascript there ware ways that you can write tests that will emulated the client code for gwt but they are really slow currently we use powermockito with mockito 195 because we cant update to a later mockito however if mockito had this support it would be much easier to do the testing || this discussion has been very active and helpful thank you everyone for participating!i think we have sufficient background information to make a final decision @mockito/core shall we discuss this on slack and write a wiki page on our full analysis and final verdict? then we can inform the community for a final review (of a potential implementation) and round up this feature || > shall we discuss this on slack and write a wiki page on our full analysis and final verdict? then we can inform the community for a final review (of a potential implementation) and round up this featurehas the verdict on static support been reached? || we have not every single core member has been swamped with various irl activities probably this fall we will be back in full force this is one of the features that we will be addressing :smile:  || the team was not actively working on this the ticket is marked """"please contribute"""" for a reason ) currently i work with @thekingnothing on creating mockito apis so that powermock can cleanly integrate (#1110) this will effectively provide reasonable support for static mocking hope this clarifies the status! thank you for reminder - this is useful for us to manage our priorities || static methods are totally ok you just have to know when to use themi think the following code is entirely correct and sufficiently abstracted for the purpose of a modern-day application:    // guava imports    class applicationresources {      // points to a file in the war      private static final charsource default_config_source  resourcesascharsource(resourcesget(""""etc/defaultconfig"""") utf_8)      static charsource defaultconfigsource() {        return default_config_source      }    }i need to access a static value in my application but for the purpose of proper testing i need to test various default values so it makes sense to provide another `charsource` during the tests than at runtimejust imagine that this is embedded in some jee application there is no sense in writing this method as non-static i could write `new applicationresources()defaultconfigsource()` what is that code? is it real? others might imagine i make this class a (singleton) bean a bean requires the class to be public i dont want any of its method to be accessed outside of the package so there are no reasons to make this class public so this class has no reasons to be a beanhowever i still have to test classes that use this class but im stuck in the testing because i just cant mock its methods (besides using all the workarounds mentioned above)i agree that mocking static method should be used very very rarely but it should exist for those rare cases || personally i plan to add this feature i still need to do some ground work in byte buddy to make this feasible it is not as easy as i hoped unfortunately and it might take some time the same goes for the seamless integration with powermockif anybody would be willing to sponsor the development i am happy to use paid hours within my open source commitment this might take a few more month to complete but i am certain to finish this at some point java 9 compatibility takes priority at the moment || **tldr:** mocking static methods can be implemented mostly like regular mocking with [a few quirks when spying on static methods with side-effects](https://githubcom/moltmann/dexmaker/wiki/experiments-with-mocking-static-methods-via-mockito#spying-and-doreturn)i implemented a [prototype](https://githubcom/linkedin/dexmaker/compare/mastermoltmann:staticmock) of this for the dexmaker based mocking used on android examples and tests can be found in [mockstaticjava in the diff](https://githubcom/linkedin/dexmaker/compare/mastermoltmann:staticmock#diff-923767ff4d088765b531f9151e31b1c3r127)i summarized my observations on a [wiki page](https://githubcom/moltmann/dexmaker/wiki/experiments-with-mocking-static-methods-via-mockito) || i think i found a [nicer version for mocking static methods via `doreturn()when()`](https://githubcom/moltmann/dexmaker/wiki/experiments-with-mocking-static-methods-via-mockito#create-temporary-object-just-for-calling-static-methods) so the total interface for static methods could be designed as:    try (staticmockinginprogress<myclass> token  spystatic(myclassclass)) {        when(myclassastaticmethod())thenreturn(â€œmockedvalueâ€)        assertequals(â€œmockedvalueâ€ myclassastaticmethod())                doreturn(â€œfakevalueâ€)whenstatic(myclassclass)anotherstaticmethod()        assertequals(â€œfakevalueâ€ myclassanotherstaticmethod())    }        assertequals(â€œoriginalvalueâ€ myclassastaticmethod())    assertequals(â€œoriginalvalueâ€ myclassanotherstaticmethod())in summary we could limit the necessary changed to:- `mockstatic`/`spystatic` instead of `mock`/`spy` this is required as `mockstatic`/`spystatic` needs to return a token to define the scope of the mocking instead of a mocked object- `doreturn()whenstatic(class)` instead of `doreturn()when(object)` this is necessary as when mocking a static method there is no mocked object || addendum to previous comment i think we should also have a `resetstatic(class<t> class)` method then using the staticmockinginprogress object becomes optional but recommended || hey @moltmann thank you for taking a stab at the prototype!given that we provide an api for mocking statics in mockito-core will you be able to come up with the implementation in dexmaker? can you implement static mocking in dexmaker right now with current version of mockito-core api? for example can you add ```mockitostatic``` class to dexmaker and offer static mocking to dexmaker users? if not what are the problems with mockito-core api that block you || i am trying to sum up all discussion i had and what i learnt from this threadi updated my prototype at https://githubcom/moltmann/dexmaker/tree/staticmock using - whenstatic - explicit finishstaticmocking# stubbinghow does """"when"""" work for static methods?## when(Î»ambda)### suggested apis```when(() -> myclassmymethod())thenreturn(""""mocked return value"""")doreturn(""""mocked return value"""")when(() -> myclassmymethod())verify(() -> myclassmymethod())```### problems#### not clear what method is calledif the lambda calls two methods eg:```doreturn(""""mocked return value"""")when(() -> myclassfirstmethod()secondmethod())```or ```doreturn(""""mocked return value"""")when(() -> {    object o  myclassfirstmethod()    return osecondmethod()})```which method should we set up mocking for? `myclass#firstmethod()` or `?#secondmethod()`- we need to make sure the return type matches the parameter of doreturn we only know the return type of the the lambda ie the return value of secondmethod hence we have to set up mocking for the second method  we dont set up mocking for `myclassfirstmethod()` what should `myclassfirstmethod()` do? call the real method? return null? to make the code above work `myclassfirstmethod()` has to call the real method but this might have side effects the point of the `doreturn()when()` syntax is to avoid side-effects- the second method is most likely an instance (non static) method should we allow setup for instance methods using the when-with-lambda?i think we need to enforce only a single mocked method call on a mock in the lambda hence we have to listen to all possible methods calls and intercept them once a second one or one of the wrong return type is intercepted we need to throw an exception hence above examples will throw an exception##### possible extensionone possible extension would be do declare a restriction on what to intercept like```doreturn(""""mocked return value"""")when(myotherclassclass () -> {    myotherclass o  myclassfirstmethod()    return osecondmethod()})```which declares that we want to set up mocking for `myotherclass` not `myclass`#### conflict between old and new doreturn-when```doreturn(() -> """"a"""")when(() -> myclassfirstmethod())```in above case mockito needs to decide if this is the new setup method or an incomplete version of ```supplier<string> m  mock(supplierclass)doreturn(() -> """"a"""")when(m)get()```it can do this by checking if the parameter to m is a mock during runtime but the when(Î»ambda) api needs to support both cases hence when(Î»ambda) has to return a lambda type ie```lambdastubber<supplier<t>> doreturn(supplier<t> ret) {    return new lambdastubber<supplier<t>>(ret)}public static class lambdastubber<t> implements stubber {    supplier<t> when(supplier<t>) {            }}```##### possible extensionthis issue might be mitigated by introducing```doreturn(() -> """"a"""")whenstatic(() -> myclassfirstmethod())```## `t whenstatic(class<t>)````doreturn(""""mocked return value"""")whenstatic(myclassclass)mystaticmethod()verifystatic(myclassclass)mystaticmethod()````doreturn()whenstatic(myclassclass)` returns a mock instance of `myclass` with all instance methods throwing a stubbing exception so the user will not accidentally call a instance method on this special stubbing-mock### problems`doreturn()whenstatic(myclassclass)` returns a mock instance of `myclass` hence calling `doreturn()whenstatic(myclassclass)mystaticmethod()` is equivalent to```myclass m  mock(myclassclass)mmystaticmethod()```while it is valid java to call static methods on instances all ide code checkers linters and tools like errorprone will light up like a christmas tree and tell you not to do it# life-time of static mockingregular instance mocking is tied to an objects lifetime static methods do not have such a life-time hence when to know when to reset the methods and stop collecting invocations## `mockstatic(class)` -> `finishstaticmocking(class)`this is the most basic solution the advantage is that this works with every possible test-framework and if someone wants to have a nicer api they can eg build a `autoclosable` that automatically calls `finishstaticmocking()` when a try-with-resources block is exited## mockitosessionsas far as i understood there can only be one session at a time hence scenarios with interleaved life-cycles of static mocking can not be supported example:```mockstatic(aclass)mockstatic(bclass)when(am())thenreturn(""""mocka"""")when(bm())thenreturn(""""mockb"""")assertequals(""""mocka"""" am())finishstaticmocking(aclass)assertequals(""""mockb"""" bm())finishstaticmocking(aclass)```of course if the user wants to use sessions (or other session like tools such as the mockito junit runner) they should apply to static mocking too || i implemented the recommendation of https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/1013#issuecomment-291045005 in :- code:

though some parts of the implementation use nasty reflection || @moltmann could you please open pr for your changes?  || @avanathan my code is currently based on [dexmaker-mockito](https://githubcom/linkedin/dexmaker) and does not work with the bytebuddy mock maker used by vanilla mockito i think we should first agree on the interface before trying to make this work with bytebuddy || @moltmann thank you for working on this! i plan to re-engage soon || i didnt see it discussed but the main use case for me wanting to mock a static field is logging   popular logging frameworks (especially slf4j) store a log object in a static field `private static final logger logger  loggerfactorygetlogger(myclassclass)`in tests i would like to mock this field so i can validate logging calls at critical places in the business logic for business reasons of audit trails and operations support || imo you shouldnt mock the logger but assert whether the logging output contains the desired value  || @binkley can we go one step back?if you have business reasons to write some audit logs they _might_ be part of your business ergo: your model and your domain thats perfectly fine in banks insurance security other areasare you really sure _techy_ logs are the way to satisfy the business needs?eg in slf4j/logback its a matter of the configuration for the precise runtime in production so even if you test static calls theres no guarantee that this will happen in real business someone may misconfigure slf4j so again _maybe_ the audit should become explicit part of your model? || @binkley >i didnt see it discussed but the main use case for me wanting to mock a static field is logging > in tests i would like to mock this [static] fieldthis feature is not intended to set mocks on fields neither with modifer static private or final it is meant to enable mocking for static methods in other words this feature would enable you to stub the static logger factory method eg like: `when(loggerfactorygetlogger(myclassclass))thenreturn(mockedlogger)` || there are some use cases where ive to mock the third party code while running unit tests `ioutilstostring(file file )`or `requestcontextgetcurrentcontext()`im not sure how and why should i refactor this code  || @ghsatpute - the standard way is with a wrapper eg ```public interface ioutilswrapper {    default string tostring(file file ) {        return ioutilstostring(file file )    }}```and pass in either a mock of ioutilswrapper or the real thing || @gregdthomas  are you suggesting that in my actual code i should use `ioutilswrapper` class? that would be an overkill if i have too many such methods? or am i missing something?  || @ghsatpute  - in the absence of the ability to mock a static yes alternatively consider the user of powermock - https://githubcom/powermock/powermock/wiki/mockito#mocking-static-method || i already wrote an extension on top of mockito+aspectj with syntax like```when(() -> yourclassstaticmethod())thenreturn()```its available here: https://githubcom/iirekm/varia/tree/develop/ajmockmaybe the good way of thinking is:- pure mockito - for new pretty shiny testable code- ajmock - for legacy untestable code to be able to add tests to it without modifying the source code (which is hard and may break something) || with all of the text expended on the horrors of static methods i have yet to read any solid justification for these strongly held opinions   it really appears to me to be pure dogma and not engineeringas a software developer static methods have a great appeal  the explicitly disavow any state  thats a big deal and a very very good thing   fwiw in part due to their lack of state static methods are themselves _more_ easily covered in junit teststhe _only_ down sides to static methods that i can see are a) they cannot be overridden by derived classes which leads to b) they are more difficult to mock in unit testsdownside a) is actually a good thing and easily worked around using a non-static wrapper (as illustrated above) in use cases that require suchwhich leaves mocking   and only mockingso if there is a good way to help deliver well tested code im all for it  so please add support for mocking static calls directly to mockito core as soon as is convenient || """"the explicitly disavow any state""""so whats the point to mock/stub them if it is just a pure logicstatic methods actually allow state modification of any accessible part of app thats the main problem why ppl would like to override its behaviour || from my point of view mockito is a mocking tool not a linter it should not tell you whether your code is good or bad or dictate how to write it its all a matter of taste like the endless """"tabs vs spaces"""" debate and you wont find 2 developpers with the same coding style so just let people setting up their linting tool the way they want and even if you think that static is evil since static methods are allowed in java anyway your software can possibly use 3rd party librairies that use them and that you would like to mock and wrapping everything is overkill (but thats also a matter of taste :) ) || @dbacinski sometimes even though they contain pure logic they sometimes use the hardware/network resources for example reading some file or getting something over the internet would probably be better represented as a static method as they dont contain any state but id like to mock them when im running the test case i agree with @anthofo  im using `ioutilstostring(classpathfile)` i could right away use this method in my code but because of this limitation 1 ive had to write a wrapper class2 create an instance of that class in my caller method 3 mock when doing testing and just because i cannot mock the static third-party method i could write less code/classes if i was able to mock static methods  || id argue that a static method that uses the network or disk isnt a good static method - it relies too much on external inputs for it to be a pure function but thats personal preference clearly many people do this and as such i do think mockito should offer the option to mock statics || > i am torn on this one if we provide this possibility we might invite developers into bad practices every time a developer uses this feature it should be very explicit that it is bad practice imo would it be possible to come up with a solution that is clear on this front but still allows the developer to opt-in?imho 1 mockito should not be used as an enforcer for avoiding static methods may be some other tools need to take care of this 1 if we add static method testing feature in mockito - we could use mockito to test legacy code  || >> """"the explicitly disavow any state""""> so whats the point to mock/stub them if it is just a pure logic> static methods actually allow state modification of any accessible part of app thats the main problem why ppl would like to override its behaviourin my case we have a directory structure that contains hundreds of thousands of files  these files were created by a complex analytical application executed repeatedly over several years  different versions of that software wrote different flavors of the files in varying sub-directory structures  i have a static class that builds paths to those files based on a small number of inputs  all of the """"state"""" which is based on known behavior of different versions of the analytic software is known at compile time and has almost no dependenciesto unit test software that consumes these files without re-creating the runtime environment its really helpful to mock the results of the path generating static methods to point to files packaged as test resourcesagain the _only_ case against static methods is that mockito doesnt support mocking them (or is preventing powermock from doing so)!!   every other argument against boils down to a style preferenceotherwise there are any number of valid use cases where all state is known at compile time but that it is very helpful to mock the results for unit test purposes || > id argue that a static method that uses the network or disk isnt a good static method - it relies too much on external inputs for it to be a pure function but thats personal preference clearly many people do this and as such i do think mockito should offer the option to mock statics@gregdthomas i think people use static methods because they dont have any state sure there are too many external inputs but there is _**no state**_ if i read the file a thousand times ill get the same output and i dont think that if we make it no-static those _external inputs_ automatically gets solved basically ive to write the same piece of code for stateful code use class methods and for stateless methods use static  || > > to all: it seems to me theres a fundamental divide in this thread between people

convincing the other so im not sure where that leaves us> > id say that the divide is between people who want to design their code properly and those who want to take the path of least resistance (which isnt a wrong choice sometimes)this really highlights the difference between discussing the needs of the feature and judging the development choices of other teamsi think @rdicroce got it right what we see in this issue is that many people are perfectly comfortable buidling wrapper classes for this single exclusive need [or even powermock which does a bunch stuff but again for this single purpose] and others wish they could just test the code they already gotfor the first group of people no action is needed but also nothing would be lost -- theyd just keep using mockito while skipping the static mocking for the second group i think mockito [core by the way] is lacking a feature that could genuinely help themin any case thanks to the team for even investigating this i hope it gets implemented || what is the current state of this fr? is there any progress is there any decision? || this is not currently pursued it is technically possible but it is a bigger venture and i am currently lacking the time for it id love to do it but i would need at least three full time weeks for it and between projects and other open source work i cannot currently find that much space || so any plans on supporting this? || as @raphw said it is technically possible i managed to write [a prototype to stub static methods](https://githubcom/christianschwarz/mockito-lambda/commit/a0101976f7af5db5effa39269ec69538eb6f2b78) it also allows to stub `static void` methods using a lambda like that:```mockitomockstatic(staticutilclass)when(()->staticutilvoidfoo())thenthrow(new runtimeexception())// or  equivalent when(staticutil::voidfoo)thenthrow(new runtimeexception())```unfortunatly the idea to use lambda as `when`  argument was rejected years ago (#828 ) therefore the first step should be to define a scope and an api that needs to be accept by the mockito-core developers  || the issue exists for about 3 years so any plan to support it? || > so any plan to support it?the op of this issue is the founder of mockito so the answer is yes due to the lack of time non of the core developers cant work on it  i would like to work on it but i am afraid that a pr wont get reviewed or merged due to the shortage of time of the core mockito developers an other option would be to fork mockito but that undertaking is to much effort for me alone since you need to setup the whole release infrastructurenevertheless everyone reading this is invited to participate either by api discussion prototypes or other toppics to drive this || getting this feature right takes a lot of effort and time as rafael pointed out moreover in the current situation with the pandemic we are finding ourselves with less time on our hands and are dealing with problems not related to programming ðŸ˜¢ there is consensus in the core team that we do want this feature we have written prototypes and explored this space based on these explorations we had to conclude that it was more challenging than we initially expected this is not something you can implement in 1 pr and has implications on the larger architecture of mockitowhile you of course have the option to fork these problems would remain we expect you will have a difficult time implementing proper static method support in the current project structure thats to say: it is probably possible to hack it in but that is not good for longterm maintenance of the project given that mockito is a mature project used by a lot of users implementing the"
"e hacks would not be the appropriate decision for the large majority of our usersin my personal judgement this feature points to the issue that mockito has matured over time but we are now finding shortcomings in the current architecture a better look at the internal implementation and a potential overhaul would help us plan support for this feature however i think we are obligated to maintain api stability and prevent a mockito 2 upgrade scenario where customers face a large cost of upgrading getting that balance right is difficult and time-consuming time that we do not have at this moment in time given the state of the world and the effect that has on our mental/physical health || what is the state of mockito + powermock?   mostly i use mockito  i end up using different versions on different projects  my recollection is that with newer versions of mockito it _intentionally_ no longer plays nice with powermock   ie all that is required is to re-enable an api or two to re-nable powermock  no need to duplicate that feature set || i am not sure where you got that information from but that is not our intention if powermock 2 and mockito 3 dont work together that is a bug || @charliereitzel i personally dont like using powermockito since coverage tools show zero coverage for the classes in which weve used powermockito  || @ghsatpute hi ganesh i have heard that complaint in the past  but have had a problem getting coverage measurements for the class under test while using powermock    i am assuming of course you dont apply powermock to the class under test || @timvdlippe forgive me if i have lost the specifics  its been a couple years  last i checked i could not use any version of powermock with any 2x version of mockito and the reason was that certain methods that were public in 1x became private in 2x   if that issue has been resolved in the meantime i would suggest the following:1 verify it is in fact possible mock static methods using powermock 2 and mockito 32 close this issue as """"wont fix"""" with the guidance to use powermock for that purposepersonally i agree that if you find yourself wanting to mock a static method first think hard about it and see if there isnt a better way to get the job done   but sometimes you just need a sledgehammer!  :--) || @charliereitzel https://mvnrepositorycom/artifact/orgpowermock/powermock-api-mockito2 should be compatible with mockito 2/3 for more info see https://githubcom/powermock/powermock/wiki/mockito-2-maventhis ticket is about supporting static method mocking in mockito without having to rely on powermock since we see merit in supporting that use case in mockito we will keep this issue open || i just had a look at the suggestion of @christianschwarz - nicely done! (could you squash the commits and remove the formatting/import changes?)i will try to make this my summer project i know a lot of people want this and i just had too much byte buddy maintenance lately to commit to it but i still really want to do it i have to have a deeper look at christians solution and check all edge cases but i think the api makes sense and after some clean up this might be the way to go! || alright something bit me yesterday and i built a poc with a slightly different approach what always bothered me about static mocks was their potential inferrence with parallel test cases and so forth but all of this is solvable i put the working prototype on a branch and suggest this api:https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/static-mock/subprojects/inline/src/test/java/org/mockitoinline/staticmocktestjavaill clean it up and add documentation feedback welcome! || hi rafael  i like the scoping of the mock via closable interface   +1   also java 8 method references make a lot of sense in this context  just out of interest this looks a bit different than christians use of lambdas  or does it work out the the same thing (w/ the java compiler handing mockito a `function`  to mock either way)? || thanks @raphw  for that and glad to see some progress on it i do want to reiterate that you should not take this project on if you do not have the mental/physical capacity to do so as a fellow maintainer i would prefer if you stay in the running rather than overloading you with this projectlet us know if we can assist you in any matter possible very glad to see an elegant solution this problem so props for figuring this out! evidence yet again we can be lucky we have you on our side working on these problems ðŸ˜„  || @raphw glad you took some inspiration and motivation out of my attempt i had quick look into  your branch looks like you are going full steam ahead some questions and toughts:-  the scope meant to automatically reset the static mock after usage right?   - it is safe when used with """"try with resource"""" but people might use it without its not possible to enforce it   - the try with resource adds noise / ceremony to the test it self  an other option is to do the reset automatically after a test   - how to mock multiple static classes?   - can i stub a static method in a before-each so it is not required to stub it in every test? - on twitter you wrote the static mocks are thread local   - what if i am testing a larger component that runs code in multiple threads how to do that?      || hi christianthanks for your prototype it helped me to put the last bits of the puzzle on its place the thing that bothers me the most with static method mocks is the inability to run tests in parallel it can really add a lot of confusion since not everybody expects it for example when adjusting a build script this way it is fully safe i think for now we leave it this way it would however not be difficult to add a `mocksettings` option to include additional threads or to even make the mock global i still think we leave it out of the first version and consider it for latermocking multiple classes for static methods is fully possible:```try (  mockedstatic<foo> foo  mockitomockstatic(fooclass)  mockedstatic<bar> bar  mockitomockstatic(barclass)) {  // }```the only thing that is not allowed is to mock the same class twice but mockito will detect this and throw an exception i also adjusted the junit integration to make the ceremony superfluous you can simply do:```java@mock mockedstatic<foo> foo```in a junit test when using the rule or extension and the same works in junit 5s extension for method parameters mockito will then take care of the lifecycle if the explicit model is used and the mock is not closed it is currently unsafe we could however add functionality to clear all mocks on a thread within the runner and rules where i do however expect the annotations to be used mostly  || @raphw i know i am a little late to the party is it possible to simplify the api a bit so users are not forced to use the mockstatic instance like this:```try(mockedstatic<dummy> ignore  mockitomockstatic(dummyclass)) {            when(dummy::foo)thenreturn(""""bar"""")            verify(dummy::foo)            }```once the `verification`-lambda is executed you know that `dummyfoo()` was called then you can map the `dummyclass` to the corresponding `mockedstatic` object this way users dont need to reference the `mockedstatic` object this also allows to simplify futher by obmitting the try-with-resource eg:```mockitomockstatic(dummyclass ()>{  //note: the lambda defines the scope of the static mock  when(dummy::foo)thenreturn(""""bar"""")  verify(dummy::foo)})``` || i can see for myself that we add something like: ```javamockitomockstatic(dummyclass)scope(() -> {    })````mockstatic` is already overloaded i would like to avoid another overload to keep it synchronous with `mock` not sure if i like the lambda syntax it works nicely with no-arg methods but not so much otherwise i think at least that introducing it into the standard api should be another ticket if accepted || thank rafael you for the constuctive discussion and considering other opinions and approches such a behaviour is rarly found !> not sure if i like the lambda syntaxyes i know what you mean it adds noisetalking about the scope: an other option is to enable static mocks via`@staticmock` or `staticmock(class)` and then reset/disable them automatically after each test if required users can call `resetstatic(class)` in the test || i dont think i would support a lambda-solution or a solution that relies on a return type if we would return a special interaction method where you later have to call `close()` yourself then you can assign this to any variable/field and make it longlived this opens up a whole can of worms with working with static method mockingtherefore for me one requirement for static method mocking is that it is explicitly limited to scope and cant escape that scope the `try`-solution addresses this point but the lambda return call does not || when you use the lambda you will be safe the static mock will only life in the scope of the lambda```mockitomockstatic(dummyclass)scope(() -> {    })```the mock is generated when you call the `scope()` method then the lambda/scope is executedafter that the mock will be closed/reset there is no way to escape the scope but this extra method and lamda add complexity same goes for the overloaded mockstatic method that accepts the scope/lambda ----the `mockedstatic` approach dont give you guarantees if the user doesnt use try-with resource like this:```var dummy mockitomockstatic(dummyclass)dummywhen(dummyfoo())thenxxx()```the mocking/stubbing/verifing will work as expected but leaves the class in a mocked state the automatic close/reset at the end of a test is an option that can be considered || replacing `mockitomockstatic(klass () -> { â€¦ })` with the fluent `mockitomockstatic(klass)scope(() -> { â€¦ })` may look nice (to others not necessarily to me :-)) but then the compiler wont complain when the scope is missingif you want to force a scope please make it a parameter of (all overloaded) `mockstatic` || the problem with only allowing it in a given lambda scope is that any alternartive life-cyle management approaches are not supported having the construct available for example allows for the use in junit extensions and rulesthe try-with-resources construct can be forgotten but it is also the most flexible option i suggest we stick to it for the first release  || im late to this conversation and im glad to see that there is some movement on this i am firmly in support of the addition of static method mocking to mockito it is true that there are workarounds - someone wrote: """"every problem can be solved with a layer of abstraction"""" - but then there is the corollary that seems to be forgotten: """"except for the problem of too many layers of abstraction"""" simplicity should be a goal of code - we shouldnt add complexity without good reason and layers of abstraction add complexity at all levels (in development and at runtime) in the case of mocking statics it is certainly *possible* to get around this problem (to an extent) by adding a new layer of abstraction - but this adds complexity we may often decide the trade-off is worth it to make our code testable but wouldnt it be better if you didnt have to make the trade-off? if you could mock statics without paying the price of adding an extra level of indirection? also adding a layer of abstraction is only possible in code that i have control over what if im using a third-party library? `systemcurrenttimemillis()` is a classic example - theres no good way to reliably simulate code running at different system times without mocking this static method (you can use wrappers in your own code but theres no guarantee that all the 3rd-party libraries you might want to use will)i also wanted to throw a couple of things into the mix in commentary on the current implementation-in-progress:1 _constructors are effectively static methods_ i think it would be great if whatever mechanism is implemented here to mock static methods can also be used to mock constructors doing so gives you a way to inject mock instances of dependencies into your class-under-test without requiring you to rewrite the class-under-test for this purpose jmockit provides such a capability and i would love to see mockito have it too (as jmockit doesnt play will with osgi whereas mockito does)2 there has been talk about the temporal scope of the static mock but i think that consideration also needs to be given to the caller scope: which classes will see the mocked method and which will see the original im thinking here in particular the case of mocking methods of common classes (eg jdk classes) that might also be in use by the test framework the test framework will rely on the normal behaviour of the mocked class while you will want the class-under-test (and its dependencies) to see the mocked behaviour it wouldnt be a good idea to mock (eg) `systemcurrenttimemillis()` if it was going to be seen by the test framework as it will mess up the running of the test but it would be great to be able to mock it for the code-under-test || thanks this is about my train of thought additionally it is sometimes just not feasible to refactor code either the code is not yours or you cannot change a legacy code base (immediately) in these cases it is very convenient to have the possibility to mock static methods also to give you safety if you are changing code in intermediate steps to finally remove them construction mocks are in the making and will be part of 350 you can have a look at my open prs if you want to give it a test run its fully working and i am only waiting for the mockito team members to return from their vacations to get some feedback from them before mergingfinally note that mockito forbids mocking the static methods of `system` (and `thread`) those methods are to much cemented into class loading which happens in the same thread at some point we might add instrumentation to class loading to temporarily disable the static mocks within it to make mocking these classes too where we also would need to disable their intensification properties you can however easily mock `instantnow()` ||

with mockito 2220 which should be a release before  the commit but the error is still there https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/releases?afterv2230edit: what fixed the issue for me was removing the `mock-maker-inline` resource file || the inline mockmaker is not supported on android (as listed in the exception) however we should probably not crash before we can show that message to the user i would welcome a pr to fix this problem || @timvdlippe what should people do for android then? kotlin uses final classes only || @raphw what is our advice for android? i dont remember what our final resolution was for inline + android for kotlin || i just started using https://mockkio/ its kotlin friendly also || on android the inline mock maker wont work (neither will mockk which uses the same approach as we do) it does not support the instrumentation api alltogetheri do agree that the error message is misleading currently preparing a pr to improve this || you can achieve this by using comlinkedindexmaker:dexmaker-mockito-inline for apis > 28 ||;1;0;fixes #1855 and #939: improve error message when the inline mock maker cannot be used;"

investigation it appears the first test is failing twice (once in the test and once in the testfinished listener) this code:https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/573bf0df389964d7fdeb4de486882d4599b8033c/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/runners/defaultinternalrunnerjava#l75-l96line 81 is where it fails the second time if we navigate down the call hierarchy it appears it fails because the static mock has already been cleaned up so the framework doesnt think its a mock and fails with a `notamockexception`  since it fails there it doesnt set the listener to null which will in-turn result in the mocks not being initialized on the next test thats ran (hits line 51):https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/573bf0df389964d7fdeb4de486882d4599b8033c/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/runners/defaultinternalrunnerjava#l42-l59since the mocks are not initialized for the second test it ultimately causes the `nullpointerexception`its also causing the remaining tests after the first test failure to bounce back and forth between `nullpointerexception` and `notamockexception` the reason for this appears to be because [this failure](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/573bf0df389964d7fdeb4de486882d4599b8033c/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/runners/defaultinternalrunnerjava#l67) object never gets reset after its processed so it keeps restarting the chain of throwing the two exceptions back and forthalso i did include a sample test that manually opens and closes the mocks (doesnt use mockitojunitrunner) and everything is working as expected using the try-with-resource works fine as welli did investigate further and noticed something related to this might have been addressed in [this pr](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1968/files?file-filters%5b%5djava#diff-d24b5a756bdb953f5effcddac2b17b72r42) it only updated the findstubbings method to skip the static mocks though was the allinvocationsfinderfind() method intentional left out of that or just an oversight?;just tried the tests with using mockitorule and its working as expected as well || @raphw this issue still exists in 346 was the pr supposed to fix all of this or only a part of it? the linked example above still causes npe this one: [mockitojunitrunnerwithmockedstatictest](https://githubcom/cybermite/mockito-static-npe-example/blob/bdd30465632b21c36ce7635929e7825c5878ee83/src/test/java/org/mockito/example/mockitojunitrunnerwithmockedstatictestjava) || i was under the impression that i fixed it but i will take another look if it is not i refactored your test and added it to the built but maybe i broke it in the process || i just ran the test with the latest mocktio and it works as expected are you sure that you are running the right version?  || yep just doubled checked its using 346 are you running my test class (without modification) or your refactored version of it? if you modified it can you send me modified one and ill double check it || copy pasted it as it is i to the release/3x branch  || okay sorry for the confusion when i was investigating this issue on july 25 i must have installed into locally and it got shoved into my local m2 repo as 346 without the fix then when you fixed it and i updated the pom version to point to 346 it didnt redownload it because it was already in my local repoi deleted it from my local m2 repo and redownloaded it from maven-central everything is good now thanks! || perfect gradle does not work with snapshot versions happened to me a few times too  ||;1;0;does not include static mocks in regular listener logic as it might distort existing mock collectors that do not expect scoped mocks

pulled the *constructor-dispatch* branch this morning before giving you the `threaddumpstack()` output i just switched to branch *release/3x* (356 next 357) applied my logs and run my tests again : same results || strange ill investigate could you make sure that you dont have a stale version? you are using *mockito-inline* or are you configuring the mock maker manually?  || > could you make sure that you dont have a stale version?i already checked using `mvn dependency:tree` but it says im using 357 (im using the *release/3x* branch)i will try to copy my project use v352 and remove code step by step until i can reproduce the bug with only a few files so i can provide you a reproducible example----> you are using mockito-inline or are you configuring the mock maker manually?im using mockito-core :```xml<dependency>    <groupid>orgmockito</groupid>    <artifactid>mockito-core</artifactid>    <version>357</version>    <scope>test</scope></dependency>```and i do not configure anything manually i just have the `src/test/resources/mockito-extensions/orgmockitopluginsmockmaker` config file which contains```mock-maker-inline``` || that explains it you can drop the config and just use the inline artifact which defines the nock maker for you the member accessor is another plugin which requires manual activation using a similar file if you dont use the other artifact  || > you can drop the config and just use the inline artifact which defines the nock maker for youi used mockito-inline v356 all tests passed but 3 the 3 that fails are new ones (not the ones who failed before) and none of them use mockito (but all of them are on enums apparently `myenumvalues()` returns an array with null values inside) but theyre executed correctly when running them manually class by class ([like i did before](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/issues/2011#issuecomment-677610343))do you know how can i generate the inline jar from the sources ? i cant provide you the logs i added in the source with mockito-inline because the jar is not generated by `/gradlew -x check clean build` || @raphw thank you for the fix and the time spent on this it works great ! || "";1;0;initializes

i wanted to add some print statements to verify that the mbase before/after values are the same> i had a look at the field state and for both activity and mockactivity contextwrappermbase is set to the same instance but only activity returns the fields valuehow can you tell that?

|| you are right i did not debug properly (intellij refuses to run the sample project for me i am back on the command line)when i inspect the transformed `contextwrapper` constructor i do however see that the field is copied within it:```        69: getfield      #40                 // field mbase:landroid/content/context        72: aload_0        73: dup_x1        74: pop        75: putfield      #40                 // field mbase:landroid/content/context```when is the `mbase` field populated? is this something done after object construction? || i created a special debug build (*println-constructor* you can run it by using your local maven repo and the *publishtomavenlocal* task of mockito) which shows what is happening by printing all field assignments it follows the pattern```<class name> // for each in hierarchy<mock object><field name> // for each field<spied field value><mock field value after setting>```this verifies that the field is actually set its very strange that the field is null again once it is used since this problem occurs only with robolectric there must be some mechanism where the value disappearsi also added a statement for the spy when it is constructed in its entirety and the field seems to be set correctly:```    debug robolectics: androidappcontextimpl@51ad277e - original androidappcontextimpl@51ad277e``````    class androidcontentcontext    comexamplemyapplicationmainactivity@6219c42b    public javalangobject androidcontentcontext__robo_data__    null    null    class androidcontentcontextwrapper    comexamplemyapplicationmainactivity@6219c42b    public javalangobject androidcontentcontextwrapper__robo_data__    null    null    androidcontentcontext androidcontentcontextwrappermbase    androidappcontextimpl@51ad277e    androidappcontextimpl@51ad277e    ``` || its very strange i optimized the example for output now and the fields seem to be set now that i changed the code:```java        field field  classforname(""""androidcontentcontextwrapper"""")getdeclaredfield(""""mbase"""")        fieldsetaccessible(true)        mainactivity activity  robolectricbuildactivity(mainactivityclass)setup()get()        object fieldbefore  fieldget(activity)        object methodbefore  activitygetbasecontext()        mainactivity spyactivity  mockitospy(activity)        throw new assertionerror(""""activity field: """" + fieldget(activity)                        + """" - mock activity field: """" + fieldget(spyactivity)                        + """" - activity getter: """" + activitygetbasecontext()                        + """" - mock activity getter: """" + spyactivitygetbasecontext()                        + """" - activity field before: """" + fieldbefore                        + """" - activity getter before: """" + methodbefore                        + """" - original: """" + activity                        + """" - mock: """" + spyactivity)```my gutt fealing is that thats some sort of initialization issue for the original object that is triggered later then mockito expects it || maybe i turned blind but simply running:```javamainactivity activity  robolectricbuildactivity(mainactivityclass)setup()get()mainactivity spyactivity  mockitospy(activity)throw new assertionerror(activitygetbasecontext() + """" - """" + spyactivitygetbasecontext())```of the current *release/3x* branch yields both fields being set correctly maybe this is something we already fixed in mockito by accident? || okay i verified that mockito creates the spy correctly in any case but something happens to the object if passed through robolecticss runner logicthis test will function correctly:```@testpublic void test1() {  mainactivity activity  robolectricbuildactivity(mainactivityclass)setup()get()  mainactivity mockactivity  spy(activity)  assertequals(""""compare base context between activity and mockactivity""""     activitygetbasecontext()     mockactivitygetbasecontext())    }```while this test will yield yield an empty spy:```javaprivate mainactivity activityprivate mainactivity mockactivity@beforepublic void setup() {   activity  robolectricbuildactivity(mainactivityclass)setup()get()   mockactivity  spy(activity)}@testpublic void test1() { assertequals(""""compare base context between activity and mockactivity""""   activitygetbasecontext()       mockactivitygetbasecontext())}```how can that be? || comparing the output of the println branch: if the mock is created in the `@before` method the `contextwrapper` constructor is never invoked what seems dubious something must be done differently here || i added a simpler test case to the robolectric tree (currently `@ignored`)https://githubcom/robolectric/robolectric/blob/master/integration_tests/mockito-experimental/src/test/java/org/robolectric/integrationtests/mockito/experimental/mockitospytestjavait is very strange ive also seen situations where the test starts passing randomly and i usually have to do a `clean` to get it to start failing again it seems to fail more consistently when running through gradle vs running through intellij this sometimes indicates a classpath issuethanks for all your investigation and putting up that println branch ill try some print debugging as well || after adding some additional debug statements it seems like the mockito instrumentation for `contextwrapper` constructor is skipped so `contextthemewrapper` tries to call the  `contextwrapper` constructor but it calls a non-instrumented one maybe the default empty constructor is private?```start of constructor for class androidappactivityinvoking super constructor class androidappactivity -> android/view/contextthemewrapperstart of constructor for class androidviewcontextthemewrapperinvoking super constructor class androidviewcontextthemewrapper -> android/content/contextwrapperstart of constructor for class androidcontentcontextinvoking super constructor class androidcontentcontext -> java/lang/object``` || from looking at the bytecode i see that contextthemewrapper calls contextwrapper():```  public androidviewcontextthemewrapper()            31: invokespecial #317                // method android/content/contextwrapper""""<init>"""":()v```however in contextwrapper the no-arg constructor is not insrumented:```  public androidcontentcontextwrapper()    code:       0: aload_0       1: invokespecial #816                // method android/content/context""""<init>"""":()v       4: aload_0       5: invokevirtual #819                // method $$robo$init:()v       8: return```the one-arg contextwrapper constructor is instrumented though:```  public androidcontentcontextwrapper(androidcontentcontext)``` || this seems to be a simpler repro of the issue (non-robolectric):** edit **nvm still looking into a non-robolectric repro: || the issue seems to be that mockito is not instrumenting the no-arg `public androidcontentcontextwrapper()` constructor yet it is the one being selected to be called from the base class `contextthemewrapper` the one-arg `public androidcontentcontextwrapper(context)` does get instrumented but the no-arg one is preferred as the one to be called from the base classdo you know what might cause mockito to skip over the no-arg `public androidcontentcontextwrapper()` constructor? || is that constructor added later by robolectrics? maybe theres some confusion around the creation order it instruments the constructors in-flight but takes basis on the reflective model you can set a breakpoint in the `constructorshortcut`s `wrap` method  does the no-arg constructor ever arrive here? if not walk a bit down the stack into byte buddy to see if byte buddy was able to resolve this constructor to begin with || yes it does seem like robolectric adds the no-arg constructor:https://githubcom/robolectric/robolectric/blob/master/sandbox/src/main/java/org/robolectric/internal/bytecode/classinstrumentorjava#l141-l153(why does it do this? i cannot say exactly that code was added many years ago) || its certainly related to that byte buddy uses the reflection api to process the members how is it even possible that the reflection api is unaware of a constructor? a class cannot add members after its loaded the jvm does not allow it i assume this also explains why it makes a difference where the mock is created does robolectrics transform classes from one class loader into another? i have a feeling this is somewhat related to parallel versions of the same class  || as a workaround mockito could prefer non-synthetic constructors for the time being  || another possible solution: could mockito only select super-constructors to call that are known to be instrumented? it should be possible to keep track of that || `constructorshortcutwrap` never hits the no-arg `contextwrapper()` constructor i am not sure how to check if bytebuddy ever resolved it but i do not believe it did || > i have a feeling this is somewhat related to parallel versions of the same classyes i believe this is happening when an android test is run initially the android sdk stubs are on the classpath which contains a small subset of the real android framework jar that are all no-ops robolectric during runtime pulls in the real android framework jars and instruments the android classes to use the real android code (plus mixes in the shadows which override the framework method implementations) || btw i think preferring non-synthetic constructors seems like a fine workaround for now i will attempt to stop adding the no-arg constructor to android objects im not sure to what extent it is still being used || actually bytebuddy does seem to find the no-arg contextwrapper constructor but `methoddescription` is null so the `wrap` method does not get invoked:![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/125547/93295297-83b9ab00-f7a1-11ea-86e6-38abf11f3642png) || yes its in the changed class file but i wonder why the reflection api does not contain those constructors thats why byte buddy cannot map them i assume that the class is reloaded somehow into another class loader what then causes this mismatchthe problem in short is that contectwrapper classgetdeclaredconstructors() does not add the added no argument constructor  || thanks for all your hard work @raphw! i am glad this is fixed || right back at you! thanks for your patient debugging help!  || "";1;0;do not exclude synthetic constructors from instrumentation fixes #2040;"

omit stack frames of causing class;this pr will fix this problems described in #2238 the main cause wasnt the `hiderecursivecall` method but `tryinvoke` methodin `tryinvoke` the original stacktrace will be passed through the configured filter after it has been modified by `hiderecursivecall`when calling `hiderecursivecall` the second argument (`current`) is set the the length of the stack trace of the causing exceptionthis will omit too much stack frames ultimately skipping the lines containing of the root exception causein this patch `tryinvoke` will try to find a better starting frame when an exception is caughtit will do this by investigating the created stack trace and look for the first entry matching the class name of the `instance` object given to `tryinvoke` this offset will then be given to `hiderecursivecall` as `current` argument instead of using the stack trace lengthif there is no `instance` object (`null`) the length of the stack trace is used (like before);;stacktraces of exceptions are trimmed too much;""hiim not sure if this is a bug or an intended behaviourwhen testing a method which throws an exception (checked or unchecked) the causing line is suppressed in the stack coming from mockitosimple example:```javapackage testimport javaioioexceptionimport orgmockitomockitopublic class testspy {    public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception {        foo spy  mockitospy(new foo())        spymessage()    }    public static class foo {        public void message() throws ioexception {            systemoutprintln(""""hello 1!"""") // line 15            systemoutprintln(""""hello 2!"""")            throw new ioexception(""""fatal"""") // line 17        }    }}```when calling message() on the spy (same happens on a full mock as well) i would expect to see line 17 in the exception causeinstead i see this:```exception in thread """"main"""" javaioioexception: fatal	at testtestspy$foomessage(testspyjava:15)	at testtestspymain(testspyjava:10)```line 15 contains systemoutprintln which is not causing the exception but is the first expression inside of the method message()i debugged this behaviour and came to `orgmockitointernalcreationbytebuddymockmethodadvicehiderecursivecall(throwable int class<?>)` which seems to be the root cause for this the stack trace given to that method includes the correct line (line 17 in this case) my stack trace in this case has 18 entries in total:```javaioioexception: fatal	at testtestspy$foomessage(testspyjava:17)	at

with primitive underlying type (nullable or not-null)and reference types (nullable or not-null) also a function can return eithernullable of not-null inline class if a function returns nullable inline classwe do not do anything special - the functions signature contains inline classhowever if the function returns not-null inline class its signature containsunderlying type thus we need to unbox the inline class (ie get underlyingtypes value) to mock the return valuefor example if we have the following inline class  inline class ic(val i: int)and we want to mock return value of a function returning the inline class  fun returnsic(): iclike  `when`(mockreturnsic())thenreturn(ic(1))then if we do not unbox the argument of `thenreturn` function we get errorabout incompatible typesthe only issue however is that we cannot check whether the function indeedreturns `ic` unless we use kotlinreflect so the following code will work  fun returnsint(): int  `when`(mockreturnsint())thenreturn(ic(1))fixes issue #1930<!-- hey thanks for the contribution this is awesomeas you may have read project members have somehow an opinionated view on what and how should bemockito eg we dont want mockito to be a feature bloatthere may be a thorough review with feedback -> code change loop--><!--which branch : -

pretty sure this is the correct method to move to<!-- hey thanks for the contribution this is awesomeas you may have read project members have somehow an opinionated view on what and how should

checklist - [ ] read the [contributing guide](https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/release/3x/github/contributingmd) - [ ] pr should be motivated ie what does it fix why and if relevant how - [ ] if possible / relevant include an example in the description that could help all readers       including project members to get a better picture of the change - [ ] avoid other runtime dependencies - [ ] meaningful commit history  intention is important please rebase your commit history so that each       commit is meaningful and help the people that will explore a change in 2 years - [ ] the pull request follows coding style - [ ] mention `fixes #<issue number>` in the description _if relevant_ - [ ] at least one commit should mention `fixes #<issue number>` _if relevant_;duplicate of #2240 ||

fully support jpms in doing that the unit tests that use mockito are all failing with    javalangillegalstateexception: could not initialize plugin: interface orgmockitopluginsmockmaker (alternate: null)    caused by: javalangillegalstateexception: internal problem occurred please report it mockito is unable to load the default implementation of class that is a part of mockito distribution failed to load interface orgmockitopluginsmockmaker    caused by: javalangreflectinvocationtargetexception    caused by: javalangnoclassdeffounderror: net/bytebuddy/dynamic/loading/classinjector$usingreflection    caused by: javalangclassnotfoundexception: netbytebuddydynamicloadingclassinjector$usingreflectionif is set system property """"orgmockitointernalnounsafeinjection"""" to true then it fails the same way trying to access $usinglookup note that this worked fine with the same versions of mockito and byte-buddy when a module-infojava wasnt presentdo i need to add an --add-opens for something?"";are you using mockito-inline? otherwise youd need to open your module to mockito  || no log4j does not use mockito-inline im not really sure what that is to be honest i didnt write any of the stuff that uses mockito in log4j i dont understand how opening the module to mockito will help resolve a class not found exception in byte buddy? wouulnt mockito have to open something? || mockito cannot open anything modules are fully encapsulated try replacing mockito-core with mockito-inline in your dependencies and make sure to use the latest version alternatively do you have a reproducing branch?  || i have checked the code into the jpms-mockito-fails branch of https://githubcom/apache/logging-log4j2  clone the repo checkout that branch and then run mvn clean install you will need java 11  and i believe you will need at least maven 361 || https://githubcom/apache/logging-log4j2/compare/jpms-mockito-fails has the full diff since this diff is quite large would it be possible to separate the directory rename? that would hopefully make it a bit easier for us to digest what the diff is and what the potential culprit could be thanks! || no it wouldnt be possible prior to this change log4j-core was an automatic module and the tests were not modules at all to convert to a jpms module the tests also had to be converted to comply with jpms the tests were being passed downstream for other modules to use in tests but they shared the same package name as the main module so the tests being passed on had to be split plus some of the test classes were using the log4j-api package namespace the diff is that log4j-core used to have an automatic module name which meant while it had a name it really wasnt a jpms module it didnt have all the restrictions placed on it that named modules do so everything was open because of the change all the tests now run on the module path instead of the class path which means everything has to conform to jpms   || the reason is pretty obvious: byte buddy is missing from the class path i do not know how the module path is assembled but i assume that the tool you are using does not know how to process an automatic module such as mockito that requires a dependency i set a breakpoint in the test and class in question and the *netbytebuddy* module is not on the module path while the class path is emptywell see how to improve the error message in such a case i assume the tooling around the module system is still lacking a few details so this might just pay offif i for example add the line:    requires transitive netbytebuddyto *logging-log4j2/log4j-core/src/test/java9/module-infojava* the problem seems to be solved for the `consoleappendertest` that yielded the error message that you described || thanks that is interesting since the class shows up with mvn dependency:tree and clearly is there since just adding the requires for it fixes the problem im not sure why that didnt occur to me id guess it is the surefire plugin setting up the class path and module path or something it delegates to it sure would have been nice to have had some kind of warning message that dependencies were being ignored anyway i will close this issue ||;1;0;fix errorprone warnings;"

deep in the stack my guess is that mockito is doing some extra validation to avoid generating bytecode it thinks would fail;rafael i took a look at this code and it wasnt completely clear to my why we are failing here the reason that is probably happening is that mockito first adds the mocked type (https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/blob/6f9108b833323345bd926f10914224d3e0a11b80/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/creation/bytebuddy/subclassbytecodegeneratorjava#l97) in this case `packageprivate`

for the mocked type which is the old classloader then it looks up the current classloader (which you changed) and then determines that they dont match thus `localmock  false`this code landed as part of supporting java 9+ modules: https://githubcom/mockito/mockito/pull/1582 it wouldnt surprise me if there is an edge case we are missingsince the new classloader delegates to the former i would have expected the classes to match and thus pass the checks but they dont presumably because of the classloader equality check can we be lenient here and allow for child classloaders to be valid as well? || the reason we fail is that a package-private type is not visible outside of its own class loader even if we defined the subclass in the same nominal package if it was loaded by a different class loader it could not see its superclass to avoid this visibility issue we fail before even attempting to create the mockwe could consider to drop the context class loader if a mocked class is package-private i am not sure why we need the context class loader to begin with but i assume its related to serialization what tends to be an edge case || i can think of a few options:1 ignore the context classloader if the type is package-private it could have failed anyway so if it succeeds might as well reap the benefit2 ignore the package-private restriction for classloaders that are not participating in the java module system by checking issealed on the classs package3 check to see if the context classloader is a child of the originating classloader although if a classloader is declaring a parent but not following the delegation patter this might cause a false negative or positive4 just load the stuff as you would and check each relevant class you load and error if the defining classloader doesnt match || ill mess around a bit more and report back if i figure out what the issue is || ok i have a the minimal fix (as in it will only affect cases that would have broken before):if the mocked type is a non-interface or non-public or any of the extra interfaces are non-public dont include the context classloader in multipleparentsclassloader iff the context classloader is a child of the classloader wed use if it wasnt includedthis fixes my issue and in general likely fixes cases where a context classloader is set that follows the parent-first delegation pattern i thought about simply removing the context loader entirely but test authors who hit this can set and unset it in a try-finally block around their mock calls if necessary and since theres no comments about why its included id be wary of breaking somebody depending on the existing behaviori am going to run this fix through googles internal suite of tests to see if it breaks anything  || 1 the
