    the changes made in this pr are as follows -* the `win32storage` list has been modified to use a class called `win32programrepository` which implements `listrespository` and `iprogramrepository` just like in packaged applications with this change all the items are stored in a concurrent dictionary and adding deleting indexing all programs has become easier as concurrent dictionary is thread safe we do not need locks while setting/deleting items* when a win32 application is added there can be a chance of duplicates to avoid this situation the `gethashcode()` function of win32 has been overridden so that the custom win32 gethashcode() function is used this ensures that no duplicates are present in the list even when we actively add or delete apps* the `win32programrepository` and `win32programrepositoryhelper` classes have been added to watch certain locations and trigger `created` `deleted` or `renamed` events whenever such an operation is performed on a file to prevent these events from being triggered for non app type files we add `filters` these filters raise events only for those particular type of applications [filters]( the `filesystemwatchers` filter out exe lnk appred-ms and url type files and call the `getappfrompath(path)` function which has been added to the win32 class this function returns the corresponding win32 item which can be added to the list * wrappers and interfaces have been added to `filesystemwatcher` `systemiofile` and `fileversioninfo` classes so that they can be mocked and tested* `shelllinkhelper` is implementing the interface `ishelllinkhelper` so that the win32 shortcut programs (lnk) can be tested* for shortcut apps `getappfrompath` doesnt give us the expected fullpath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the fullpath is set using the shelllinkhelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the  exe fullpath  from the lnkfile* for `deleted` apps since we have no more information to go on we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkresolved path* for `renamed` apps we have more information about the existing app so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list this is done so that we have an app which has the same name exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same    * manually validated it* added tests -1  to ensure that the we will not be introducing duplicates2 for each event {created renamed deleted} and app type {exe lnk appred-ms url} a test has been added to validate that the filesystemwatcher work as expected* all the other program plugin tests pass as well (https://user-images entcom/28739210/87326150-368e3400-c4e7-11ea-84d5-3f7f14ad7be2png) @bao-qian and @jjw24 this pr may be of interest to you || > i noticed the following issues while trying this pr :> > 1 results are not updated after a program is installed/uninstalled query needs to be manually changed to see updated results for example :>    a type in `notion` in the search box>    b uninstall `notionexe`>    c  press hotkey to bring up the launcher `notion` is still present in the resultsthis is not related to this pr that is how pt run is the results are obtained once for each query i dont think this is related to this pr the user has to change the query for the results to update this would be the same situation with even uwp applications/anything else as well jsonrpc is used to communicate with each plugin for each query and once the results are obtained they are displayed> 2 if i abruptly close powerlauncher (say by closing debugging session directly) the cache for the uninstalled program is still present on the next launch we should verify cache validity on startupyea i think it is a good suggestion apps which are deleted when pt run is not running also show up because of the cache issue i think it is a generic issue and i shall create it an issue so that we can work on it> 3 if i rename an internet application it keeps all the previous version as welli tested this out to ensure that this would not happen can you please share information about the app (ie lnkresolvedpath fullpath exename) so that i can repro it and try to debug > 4 i added a program using epic games which installed a `url` shortcut on desktop but this change is not detectedi tested it out with steam games and it worked as expected i shall try out epic games as wellregarding 12 i think they are not a scope of this pr regarding 3 and 4 i shall look into why thats happening and try to fix it || @somil55 i tried installing the same game on the desktop while pt run was executing in the background and it works as expected would be great if you could help me figure out those two scenarios because im not able to repro them thanks!

different grand plan  : #    ?_the general settingsjson file on being accessed by settings was throwing a file in use ioexception because it was being used by another process the way settings and runner worked before this pr is as follows: the settings on start-up checks if the general settingsjson file exists and reads from it if not it creates a new one the runner on the other hand during start-up does not save to the file (`apply_general_settings` is passed with a false save argument) there is no contention during this parthowever the issue occurs when settings tries to open the general settingsjson file everytime it needs information in any viewmodel or converter when any change is made in the settings that information is communicated to the runner and it is the runners responsibility to write to the settingsjson file however since we have one process continuously trying to read from a file and the other writing to the same file there is contentionto fix this issue the following changes have been made -* rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodels `generalsettingsconfig` a public static variable* the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up```public shellpage()        {            initializecomponent()            datacontext  viewmodel            shellhandler  this            viewmodelinitialize(shellframe navigationview keyboardaccelerators)            shellframenavigate(typeof(generalpage))        }```* therefore the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in its constructor the generalviewmodel tries to open the settingsjson file and loads the information from it if it exists if not it creates a new settingsjson file hence this variable is always initialized when settings is running this is also the only time the settingsjson file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention) from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the `generalsettingsconfig` in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the

been refactored so that they work when settings utils is passed to the setting repository generic interface previously the stub of getsettings was a generic with no type constraints hence it could be easily mocked as `<itisanytype>` however since the getsettings function must now implement the `isettingsconfig` interface the stub has been modified accordingly there is no functionality in moq to specify a generic with a type constraint other than using a custom matcher even if we go down this route the class definitions have to be modified to implement `itypematcher` and they must still be invoked individually by specifying the class as `getsettings<generalsettings>`* validated that all refactored tests pass![image]( validated that settings and all powertoys work as expected with and
