(the first remark you had concerning "sending emails" is a nice suggestion for further improvement but not necessary for merging i would say) || @tobiasdiez yes this is ready for review || thank you for the suggestions @tobiasdiez  and @siedlerchr! i have refactored the code for the most part to account for the changes and will push the code once i have implemented all changes screenshot showing the preferences window when searching:( || @captaindavinci  look at my patch: (import via git am < filepatch)i added the bidiretional binding and a listener in the handler this worked for me[0001-add-bidiretional-binding-to-searchpropertypatchtxt]( || @siedlerchr thank you for sharing the patch however this did not work for me the change listener for `searchtext` is never called i had a similar implementation except for not using `easybind` to register the callback the only way i could make this work was to add a listener to `searchbox` as well and refer to the `searchtext` property in that```searchboxtextproperty()addlistener((o p n) -> {    searchhandlersearchtextproperty()     // required so that changed are reflected})``` || hm this is odd it worked fine for me with this line:    ` searchhandlersearchtextproperty()bindbidirectional(searchboxtextproperty())`whenever i changed the text in the gui field eg key to asdfasd the view was updated and the new findings were highlighted maybe i understand you wrong but i think this is enough? under the hood the bidirectional is nothing else than a wrapper around the changelistener stuff  || also note that its necessary to have a reference to `searchtext` property accessed under the changelistener for `searchbox` could this be related to some sort of premature garbage collection?edit: for me changing the text in the gui field did not update the view or highlight the labels || bindings are created using weaklistener so they might get garbage collected but i still dont understand why it works for me with the patch i would propose you test again with my patch or at least commit the changes and let others test as well unfortunately i am the next days busy at work and probably cant help much || okay i have pushed changes in the mean time i will try testing it again ps: since the `preferencessearchhandler` does not use the `searchtext` property but only the query text can we instead bind the `searchbox` to the `filtertabs` ie not have to deal with binding the text property and string property? || thanks to both @wtfjoke and @captaindavinci for joining forces! ||

<https://githubcom/jabref/user-documentation/issues> cool that you worked on this!as a suggestion i would not follow the original design very closely instead of having different lists for required and optional fields i would add one big list of all fields with a checkbox toggling between required/optional  || thanks for the idea that indeed sounds more practical maybe a radio button column  || question which just came to my mind: do we allow changing the default entry types and their fields? eg removing a field from an entry type like article?@koppor  || yes it was possible to add/remove fields from the built-in entry types || @tobiasdiez  what is the preferred way to add new fields to a an existing entry type?i saw the entrytypesmanager with  the `addcustomormodifiedtype`  but i am not sure if this is the right approach    || yes that methods sounds right i vaguely remember that the complete entry type had to be "replaced" instead of only specifying the added/removed fields easiest way is probably to look at the original code || this looks really nice and is leagues above the original dialog in terms of user friendliness good job! || still a few things to do especially saving and removing all the fields back to the db and the prefs but at least adding to the gui already works (without any further effects) || @tobiasdiez  do you have an idea why the tableview content has these "empty" fields when i change between a list with more and fewer fields? tableview is bound bidirecitonal to the fieldsfortypeproperty         thisfieldsfortypeproperty  new simplelistproperty<>(existingfieldsfortype)```        easybindsubscribe(selectedentrytypesproperty type -> {            if (type ! null) {                list<fieldviewmodel> typesforfield  typeswithfieldget(type)                existingfieldsfortypesetall(typesforfield)            }        })```( || the table view is programmed in such a way that always the complete visible table is filled with rows thus even if there is no data the toggle buttons moreover rows are reused (ie not re-created)i think it should suffice to add the check `item ! null` to  and perhaps add an else statement with `setgraphic(null)` || thanks! that worked! || `selected field null` in stdout when i open the dialog || @burrbull  thanks for your interest however this is still work in progress and not yet ready  especially saving is not yet implemented  || in `biblatex` mode there should be 3 position: `required` `optional` `optional2` || @burrbull  we want to drop the difference between optional and optional 2 field sin the long run we had already discussion about this in the past #2790 || hi a very useful functionality in 431 was the manual sorting (not only in alphabetical order) of the fields in the edit entry panel are you planning to implement this in this version? thanks for this nice work || general functionality is now ready loading saving and removing of types is possiblealso removing and adding fields to standard types is workingremoving standard entry types like article has no effect || can someone update builds? || @burrbull  we have currently some problems

correctly loaded again from the preferences when opening the dialog || regarding the gui i jave just one more question: by default the required and optional are not shown complete i already tried to

exception || oh i have not seen that it was already mentioned previously || ah thanks i thought i had fixed this already probably forgot to commit this on my other pc just fixed it will take a bit until the binaries are updated || testing the fixed one: some corner cases:- adding several entry types without any name (or at least two types with the same name): exceptions occur when deleting them- adding several (or sometimes just one) new fields without any name: exception || thats one thing i want to prevent empty fields and empty entry types wont be allowed   will add a validator that

table for external file types and this one is that i created a viewmodel for the table and i think in the other dialog the externalfiletype is directly usedconcerning the external file types: maybe the problem is that there is a type hierarchy involved and the table uses the interface externalfiletype basically all cases could be covered with just one externalfiletype as well (#5902) || there

|| if we dont find out the root cause in mac we could add an ugly os check for linux/mac || i already stumbled upon other methods (`jabrefframein::openaction` `quit` and `about`) especially for macos did i mention that i dont like apple? 😉  || i agree with @calixtus the command there makes sense @linusdietz can you debug and report which other code triggers the `paste` command on macos? || os: macos catalina 10154 (19e287)hello everyoneim currently trying to reproduce the error of non working menu items or duplicating objects during "paste" command (from google scholar and between two bib libraries) but i canti use intellij idea to start jabrefare there any issues with copy/paste? || @gena928 just to double check: you are on latest `master` ( @linusdietz maybe you can add a screencast using [loom]( || @koppor  yes im on latest masteri downloaded last build and pulled changes from github both (last build and source code in intellij) show no error ie record inserts without duplicates || looks like i see an errorits very phantom ie i still can not understand what should i do to repeat it sometimes i have 2 entries inserted sometimes only one ill continue testing and try to do something about it || ok i need some help )) looks like `paste()` command of `maintablejava` executed twice:1) in `editactionjava` and this was deleted by current pull request now its back again? line 78:`framegetcurrentbasepanel()paste()`2) in `maintablejava` method `setupkeybindings`i tracked first case and it turns out that `editactionexecute()` called  jabrefframejava` line 740 (`createmenu()` method) when i commented that line jabref inserts only one item per each ctrl+v commandso in general paste command is called:- first time because we have `maintablesetupkeybindings` and it triggered by ctrl+v- second time because ctrl+v command triggers main menu command (edit>paste) || sorry for our late replythank you for you work in tracing this bugthe deletion of `framegetcurrentbasepanel()paste()` was the unsuccessful attempt to fix the issue in this prwould you like to create a fix for this issue following your investigations and to open a new pr so we can probably close this one and merge yours with the master branch? || @calixtus i hoped to get some ideas about solving this issue ok if there are no any ideas i will continue to investigate myself we have to disable main menu from listening "ctrl+v" and keep it listening in `maintablejava`ill be back with ideas || does ctrl + c or ctrl + x also call an edit action? maybe there is some design flaw in a hotkey that is defined twice by setupkeybindings and the the menu command || ctrl+x works in the same way1) when i press "command + x" the program deletes 2 (two) entries from current lib2) then i move the cursor to another lib and press "command + v"3) jabref inserts last entry to the new library ie one entry just disappearsit looks like jabref cut entries twicechecked from intellij and using last stable version from jabreforg  || why do we need `setupkeybindings` method in `maintablejava`? when i delete copy/paste/cut commands from it the program works finethis lines:```                    case paste:                        paste()                        eventconsume()                        break                    case copy:                        copy()                        eventconsume()                        break                    case cut:                        cut()                        eventconsume()```so why do we need those commands in `maintablejava`? || the reason is that you can define custom keybindings (options? manage keybindings) for all commands and so people can use their emacs/vim whatever paste command stylefor mac we use the keybindings and simply replace ctrl with meta in the keybindingrepositorymaybe that is part of the problem as well?```   public keycombination getkeycombination(keybinding bindname) {        string binding  get(bindnamegetconstant())        if (osos_x) {            binding  bindingreplace("ctrl" "meta")        }        return keycombinationvalueof(binding)    }``` || @siedlerchr if i remove this line of code  `binding  bindingreplace("ctrl" "meta")` i just have to use "command" button on mac instead of "control" a bit more natural for iosthe problem persistswhat about main menu? i mean if you wanna change key combinations and we remove that lines from `maintablejava` does main menu works with new key combinations for copy/pase/cut?  || i will test this on windows : options -> customize keybindings:( changed copy/paste to the following (alt gr+o and alt gr+p) i can copy and paste using those shortcuts ctrl+c and ctrl+v then dont worki also tested uncommenting the `setupkeybindings `in maintableno difference no duplicatesso now we would need someone on linux who can test this || linux user wanted! :-) || @lyzardking  could you assist in testing this on linux?

because github does not support autolinking there-->fixes #6459 fixes #6465 there are two parts of this issue1 a null is prepended to an abbreviated bibtex key2 curly brackets are not respected (in the maintables author column?)**1 fix to the prepended null***what is going on?*`bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey` gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets (eg `"{the school of life}"`) the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key (eg null if there is no name)*why is it going on?*academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg `"royal institute of technology: the school of electrical engineering and computer science"` which `generateinstitutionkey` shortens to `riteecs`*fix*replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg `the school of life` -> `l`)*what are alternatives?*1 regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of `the school of life` would be abbreviated to `sl` instead of `l`**2 fix to the author column**when the list of authors gets converted to a latex-free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex-free string is used to create/fetch an `authorlist` it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone**3 what i think is left to do**-  find out why `{the school of life}`  isnt respected in the author field of the gui-  ~~attempt to match universities etc with regex~~ assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities-  ~~update `bibtexkeygeneratortest` as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods~~ the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file-  see if the readability of `generateinstitutionkey` can be improved-  ~~change the key generator for institution/corporate names to a formatter?~~ `generateinstitutionkey` should not be a separate formatter it is only called

msoffice exporter  i think i implemented a workaround there || ah nice thank you! i will take a look! || i believe this is fixable in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` by splitting it into bibtex/latex according to whichever bibtex version are supported but the problems are1 i cant find which bibtex version we are supporting in [adr]( nor anywhere else2 `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` appears to be used both for bibtex in utf-8 (eg `"{lâtëx}"`) and for fully "expanded" text (eg `"lâtëx"`) as those are incompatible perhaps it makes sense to split the method and track down what method wants what?3 should i do this?4 i can attempt to do the same workaround but it doesnt really solve the problem (as i understand it)?i can also look at it a bit more and see if i have missed something anyway any suggestion/hint is greatly appreciated @siedlerchr  || hithanks for investigating the underlying problem is the latex2unicode (external library) kills the braces it has of course no understanding of an author refs  #4152 and #6155 i fear there is no easy solution we use the latexfree field method to not have latex code displayed in the main table #6329 i would treat this as a secondary issueregarding the second issue:> replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg the school of life -> l)what about using a formatter that uses the capital letters?  eg jabref would then become jrand orgs with abbreviations eg uno or who would stay as is similar to the title formatter || regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantif i understand things correctly there are currently three different cases relevant to #4337 and #4152assuming we are using the bibtex format described at [bibtexorg (special symbols)]( plain bibtex eg `kurt {g\"od}el`: used as the internal representation?2 bibtex "with unicode" eg `kurt {göd}el`: used for exporting to a unicode-aware file format and editing in unicode?3 formatted text eg `k gödel`: used to display to a user or export to a latex/bibtex unaware environment`bibentrygetlatexfreefield` handles case 3 while to the best of my knowledge no function/method handles case 2the issue with case 2 is that latex and bibtex are two incompatible "languages" (since some reserved words are the same) therefore if we are using the format described at [bibtexorg (format)]( the "correct" way of dealing with case 2 using `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` is to either split out the latex components and "translate" them to unicode separately or to escape the parts that are in bibtex format  if i am using the [bibtexorg format]( at least all non-nested curly bracketsl not preceded by a keyword should be escaped* `{jabref}` -> `\{jabref\}` * `proceedings of the {ieee}` -> `proceedings of the \{ieee\}`which is then dealt with correctly in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield`what i was trying to argue is that case 2 and case 3 must be dealt with differently i can deal with this after issue #6459 if that is of interest?**however i just realized that issue #6459 is case 3 and can most likely be solved by changing the order of method calls** please point out if something is unclear or incomprehensible i am trying to improve my writing skills but i am well aware that i have some practice ahead of me my only excuse is that it is still morning here x) || regarding the second issue that does sound better i cant think of any case where keeping all capitalized letters isnt good and it should be compatible with the current implementation || >regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantno problem :) we are happy for every contributor its just a complex issue its just complicated issue because it involves corporate authors and unicodei try to provide some background on this: **unicode**:originally bibtex and latex did not support unicode thats why you have to use those latex-escaping of umlauts and other charactersbiblatex the successor of bibtex supports unicode but many journals still require bibtexand many citations from online resources still contain latex-escaping of charactersoriginally jabref maintained a bidirectional mapping between latex escaped characters and their unicode equivalent some time ago we switched to the [latex2unicode library]( of course javafx has no idea of latex therefore having a title or an author encoded in latex must obviously converted to unicode for displayeg > `kurt {g\"od}el` becomes `kurt gödel`**corporate authors**:see the [biblatex manual]( section 233 corporate authors and editors:>corporate authors and editors are given in the author or editor field respectivelynote that they must be wrapped in an extra pair of curly braces to prevent data parsing from treating them as personal names which are to be dissected into their components example: `author {{national aeronautics and space administration}}`in jabref the latex2unicode formatter is called for **every field** and the formatter now receives the `string toconvert  {national aeronautics and space administration}` the latex2unicode formatter now kills the curly braces as they could indicate some latex commands and returns `string converted  national aeronautics and space administration`jabref now splits the author according to it rules and thinks its in this case two authors separated by authors the only solution i see is to check if its a corporate authors convert it to unicode and add the braces again one really difficult edge case is for example  ` author  {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}` could be easily interpreted as corporate authorsi hope my long explanation helps you a bit to understand the problem maybe you come up with an idea  || hello @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  thank you for your work in fixing this issue! and thanks for that informative context @siedlerchr  thats a very interesting edge case i think there could be a test where braces are counted to corroborate that the brace at the very beginning is not closed earlier on (that would be the case where formatting as a

6479,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,fixes generated bibtex key and display of institute authors    link issues that are  eg "333" link it eg "fixes  title of the pr must not reference an issue because github does not support autolinking there-->fixes #6459 fixes #6465 there are two parts of this issue1 a null is prepended to an abbreviated bibtex key2 curly brackets are not respected (in the maintables author column?)**1 fix to the prepended null***what is going on?*`bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey` gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets (eg `"{the school of life}"`) the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key (eg null if there is no name)*why is it going on?*academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg `"royal institute of technology: the school of electrical engineering and computer science"` which `generateinstitutionkey` shortens to `riteecs`*fix*replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg `the school of life` -> `l`)*what are alternatives?*1 regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of `the school of life` would be abbreviated to `sl` instead of `l`**2 fix to the author column**when the list of authors gets converted to a latex-free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex-free string is used to create/fetch an `authorlist` it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone**3 what i think is left to do**-  find out why `{the school of life}`  isnt respected in the author field of the gui-  ~~attempt to match universities etc with regex~~ assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities-  ~~update `bibtexkeygeneratortest` as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods~~ the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file-  see if the readability of `generateinstitutionkey` can be improved-  ~~change the key generator for institution/corporate names to a formatter?~~ `generateinstitutionkey` should not be a separate formatter it is only called

of life} isnt respected in the author field of the guii think it could be that the latex2unicode convert is called for the author field it kills the extra braces i had a similar problem in the msoffice exporter  i think i implemented a workaround there || ah nice thank you! i will take a look! || i believe this is fixable in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` by splitting it into bibtex/latex according to whichever bibtex version are supported but the problems are1 i cant find which bibtex version we are supporting in [adr]( nor anywhere else2 `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` appears to be used both for bibtex in utf-8 (eg `"{lâtëx}"`) and for fully "expanded" text (eg `"lâtëx"`) as those are incompatible perhaps it makes sense to split the method and track down what method wants what?3 should i do this?4 i can attempt to do the same workaround but it doesnt really solve the problem (as i understand it)?i can also look at it a bit more and see if i have missed something anyway any suggestion/hint is greatly appreciated @siedlerchr  || hithanks for investigating the underlying problem is the latex2unicode (external library) kills the braces it has of course no understanding of an author refs  #4152 and #6155 i fear there is no easy solution we use the latexfree field method to not have latex code displayed in the main table #6329 i would treat this as a secondary issueregarding the second issue:> replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg the school of life -> l)what about using a formatter that uses the capital letters?  eg jabref would then become jrand orgs with abbreviations eg uno or who would stay as is similar to the title formatter || regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantif i understand things correctly there are currently three different cases relevant to #4337 and #4152assuming we are using the bibtex format described at [bibtexorg (special symbols)]( plain bibtex eg `kurt {g\"od}el`: used as the internal representation?2 bibtex "with unicode" eg `kurt {göd}el`: used for exporting to a unicode-aware file format and editing in unicode?3 formatted text eg `k gödel`: used to display to a user or export to a latex/bibtex unaware environment`bibentrygetlatexfreefield` handles case 3 while to the best of my knowledge no function/method handles case 2the issue with case 2 is that latex and bibtex are two incompatible "languages" (since some reserved words are the same) therefore if we are using the format described at [bibtexorg (format)]( the "correct" way of dealing with case 2 using `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` is to either split out the latex components and "translate" them to unicode separately or to escape the parts that are in bibtex format  if i am using the [bibtexorg format]( at least all non-nested curly bracketsl not preceded by a keyword should be escaped* `{jabref}` -> `\{jabref\}` * `proceedings of the {ieee}` -> `proceedings of the \{ieee\}`which is then dealt with correctly in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield`what i was trying to argue is that case 2 and case 3 must be dealt with differently i can deal with this after issue #6459 if that is of interest?**however i just realized that issue #6459 is case 3 and can most likely be solved by changing the order of method calls** please point out if something is unclear or incomprehensible i am trying to improve my writing skills but i am well aware that i have some practice ahead of me my only excuse is that it is still morning here x) || regarding the second issue that does sound better i cant think of any case where keeping all capitalized letters isnt good and it should be compatible with the current implementation || >regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantno problem :) we are happy for every contributor its just a complex issue its just complicated issue because it involves corporate authors and unicodei try to provide some background on this: **unicode**:originally bibtex and latex did not support unicode thats why you have to use those latex-escaping of umlauts and other charactersbiblatex the successor of bibtex supports unicode but many journals still require bibtexand many citations from online resources still contain latex-escaping of charactersoriginally jabref maintained a bidirectional mapping between latex escaped characters and their unicode equivalent some time ago we switched to the [latex2unicode library]( of course javafx has no idea of latex therefore having a title or an author encoded in latex must obviously converted to unicode for displayeg > `kurt {g\"od}el` becomes `kurt gödel`**corporate authors**:see the [biblatex manual]( section 233 corporate authors and editors:>corporate authors and editors are given in the author or editor field respectivelynote that they must be wrapped in an extra pair of curly braces to prevent data parsing from treating them as personal names which are to be dissected into their components example: `author {{national aeronautics and space administration}}`in jabref the latex2unicode formatter is called for **every field** and the formatter now receives the `string toconvert  {national aeronautics and space administration}` the latex2unicode formatter now kills the curly braces as they could indicate some latex commands and returns `string converted  national aeronautics and space administration`jabref now splits the author according to it rules and thinks its in this case two authors separated by authors the only solution i see is to check if its a corporate authors convert it to unicode and add the braces again one really difficult edge case is for example  ` author  {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}` could be easily interpreted as corporate authorsi hope my long explanation helps you a bit to understand the problem maybe you come up with an idea  || hello @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  thank you for your work in fixing this issue! and thanks for that informative context @siedlerchr  thats a very

workaround i used in the msbibauthor for the ms office exporter  || "curly brackets are not respected (in the maintables author column?)" is the same as issue #6465should i leave it alone in this pr or update this one to close both? || since they are related you can update your pr to close both just add it also to the changelog then  || i am having issues finding a case that is supposed to break the method `fixauthornatbiblatexfree` ill look at it a bit longer before extending the same tests to the other methods but i dont think i will come up with anythingother than that i cant find any tests for `bibentrytableviewmodel` nor `maintablenameformatter` i dont think i should attempt to create any as at least `bibentrytableviewmodel` has gone through quite a bit of changes recently || if you cant find a case thats breaking the test its a good sign )regarding tests for other classes i think this would be beyond the scope of the pr here || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  as you now have some more deep insights into the bibtexkeypattern generation now than i can you maybe help that usere here in the forum?  || sure i will look at it i somehow missed that jabref has a forum oo || so what remains are1 preferences no longer updates without restart (eg from none to natbib) that is not within the scope of the pr and i am guessing someone is fixing it already2 weird things happens if you try to escape curly brackets in the author section of required fields i am guessing the \ is being protected somewhere i can open up an issue about it but i dont have time to look at it until the 1th of may || thanks already for your contribution and the extensive tests just let me know if its finished so far then we can review it it would be nice if you could open an issue for the two problems especially that preferences reloading i guess escaping the curly brackets should hopefully be not that common in the author field more relevant for the title field or so i guess  || > i just saw two minor style issues nitpicks but nothing importanti am trying to learn and improve nitpicking is appreciated and encouraged! :) || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27 big thanks for your work on thisi just noticed some latex commands are not cleared in the now-master-buildhas this been an issue before / is this still an issue with latex2unicodeadapter?( library is jabrefauthors in src/test/resources/testbib || which ~~file in particular~~  and which ~~settings~~ entry table "format of author and editor name"? || hum i am not sure what is going on ill have a look || most of those should be "cleared" and are cleared when i build locally but that might be something wrong with my setup || looks fine for me as well:( lastname option and do not abbreviateedit// @calixtus  do you have "show names unchanged" activated?  || i think i could reproduce @calixtus screenshot in jabref 51--2020-05-28--ffa07cd but right now i seem unable to do so again (and i have tried) || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27 if you have "show names unchanged" in the prefs activated then no conversion is happening || i see so the solution would be to change `return nametoformat` to `return latex2unicodeadapterformat(nametoformat)` or similar in maintablenameformatter || @calixtus i thought the intent of that option was to leave the names completely unchanged?also if you change that dont forget to add a cacheeditwith cache i mean something along the line of `private string authorsnatbiblatexfree` in `authorlist` || uh im not going to change anything today 😄 i was just wondering about that || hum actually that is my bad jabref 50 does indeed "clear" the latex even when `show names unchanged` is set should i open up an issue and fix this then?  || yes it would be nice if you could provide a fix (no need to create an issue before) || ok i apparently dont know how to do this i created [ || well thank you all for reviewing this pr it is very appreciated! ❤️ 🎉 🎈ill take the reviews and results to heart and make sure the

expected though please let me know if i need to change/update anythingthe  version behaves like this:if preferences > citation key patterns > overwrite existing keys is unchecked `generatekey()` in `citationkeygenerator`: * overwrites the default `citationkey` with an newly generated one only if it is blank* the default `citationkey` is not overwritten anymore (and therefore stays the same) if it is not blankbehaviour remains unchanged if overwrite existing keys is checked(let me know if i misunderstood how this feature was supposed to work in general and ill adapt the behaviour accordingly)fixes #7420-  change in changelogmd described (if applicable)-  -  -   (for ui changes)-  [](  if not created an issue at < or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository thanks a lot for your pri think using the setting citation key patterns > overwrite existing keys might be confusing this is used to warn/prevent users if they try to generate a key using the "generate key" button in the entry editor although the entry already has a key the use case is that after generating a new key old latex documents stop compiling and some users would like to prevent this as you see this has nothing to do with the importmaybe its better to add a checkbox in the import dialog another idea would be to let the users specify a cleanup preset in the preferences that is applied after an import the latter would then also 1018 @lucasf-42 @jabref/developers what do you prefer? || oh ive completely missed the mark then sorry about thatthe way i understood the description/discussion within the issue i presumed the overwrite existing keys- option was the one that governs whether the default `citationkey` of an imported entry is overwritten by a generated key based on user preferences or not (and wasnt working as intended) my badjust for my understanding in general: if the bibtex-source-string: ```@article{igor:2013eha  author         {igor kulikov}  title          {a new gpu-accelerated hydrodynamical code for numerical simulation of interacting galaxies}  year           {2013}  month          {11}  archiveprefix  {arxiv}  eprint         {13110861}  primaryclass   {astro-phim}}```` is being imported after a web search default behaviour would be to overwrite the `citationkey` of the `bibentry`-object with a generated key based on the pattern specified in `citationkeypattern`-preferences (eg `igor2013` in case of a default pattern of `[auth][year]`) if a user were to choose not to overwrite keys the `bibentry` would continue using `igor:2013eha` as its `citationkey`would that then be considered intended behaviour for an import?im afraid im not able to fully comprehend the "cleanup preferences"-solution youve mentioned so im definitely not fit to voice an opinion here ive just got a first very localised look at jabref while attempting to fix the mentioned issuenot sure about the protocol - would you like me to close this pr and await your decision on this topic? || > another idea would be to let the users specify a cleanup preset in the preferences that is applied after an importi like this option! i think it would address a lot of the confusion regarding when the citation key generator is used and what behavior it hashowever i dont think it replaces this pr i think there is a need for a "default"/global citation key generation behavior which in my opinion should be set in the `citation key patterns` preferences i consider the "unwanted" characters another example of when a "default" option is necessary and should be applied wherever/whenever the citation key generator is used> oh ive completely missed the mark then sorry about that> the way i understood the description/discussion within the issuei dont think there is such a thing as missing the mark when it comes to jabref when something leads to an improvement i think everything is up for discussion and on the mark 😛> overwrite existing keys- option was the one that governs whether the default `citationkey` of an imported entry is overwritten by a generated key based on user preferencesid argue that this is the case> "cleanup preferences"-solution youve mentioned so im definitely not fit to voice an opinion herei interpret it as essentially running a "cleanup action" on the imported entries perhaps using different preferences but otherwise same as the<img width"681" alt"skärmavbild 2021-02-15 kl  08 32 47" src" || from my point of view as i proposed in  it needs to the check needs to be  added to the import handler before the key generator is called || > from my point of view as i proposed in 7420 (comment)]( it needs to the check needs to be added to the import handler before the key generator is calledam i reading too much into your comment in that you are aligned with the "add a checkbox in the import dialog" option?in my mind the logic is that a citation key generator object is created based on preferences (`citationkeypatternpreferences`) if the importer wants to override these settings it should create a new instance of this object then it is up to the `citationkeygenerator` to adhere to these preferences admittedly this doesnt work well with `shouldwarnbeforeoverwritecitekey` perhaps i am just overcomplicating things and thinking about this in the wrong way || indeed there is no such thing as missing the mark in our cosy jabref worldthere are two things here that we shouldnt confuse:- use clicks "generate citation key" button controlled by the citation keys > overwrite existing keys preference- automatically generate keys upon import / web search instead of using the one provided by the fetcher (which most of the times is some cryptic key)although from a code point of view they are the same for a user they are quite different and one could easily imagine that a user might want to prevent overwriting manually set keys but still would like to have automatically generated keys upon importi think the best way forward would be to introduce a new preference setting "generate (new?) key on import"  that could go in the "general" tab below the other import-related preferences (entry owner + time stamp) or if you feel comfortable enough with the code create a new preference tab "import" where you put all of these 3 preferences options maybe @calixtus has more input about the structure of the preferences || thank you all for the explanations/comments i feel like ive got a better idea about the subject id have to take a closer look at the project again to see whether i feel like id be able to implement the "create a new import tab in preferences"-solutioni was wondering though wouldnt the option to decide whether or not to generate a key for a given import in the import dialogue be advantageous as well (on top of the new entry in preferences)? this way a user wouldnt have to change their preferences when importing an entry for which theyd like to go against said preference (as long as im not confusing things again) || i agree that such an option in the import dialog might be handy from time to time however this also makes the import dialog more complicated so im not sure if its a good idea to add it there maybe first try the solution via the preferences and then see if the users would like to have an option during the import as well? || @lucasf-42  it would be really nice if you could go with the simple solution first  that would be a huge benefit already for many users! we can always add an option in the import dialog later || it seems im unable to accomplish even that im afraidive managed to add an "import settings" tab as well as a checkbox for toggling the option (by attempting to copy how other tabs are implemented so nothing to write home about at all)( feature as such seems to be working as well but its messing with something (or more like: breaking something) and i have been unable to understand what exactly it is![image]( exceptions are raised once you have toggled the checkbox in the "import settings" at least once in a session as soon as you delete the last remaining entry within a libraryif the setting has not been changed in a session no matter if the option is enabled or not these exceptions are not raised when deleting the last entry in the libraryhowever the more often you toggle the option the more exceptions are thrownexample after having toggled the setting three times:![image]( want to push the branch in its current (broken) state || thanks for your continued work on this looks already pretty good concerning the error message could you copy & paste the complete stacktrace moreover it would be good to have the code with your changes at hand could you maybe push them to a different branch? || [heres]( a link to the new branch containing the code on my jabref fork (hope thats how you wanted me to do that)and this is the stacktrace thats being displayed on the console when the exception is thrown:<details><summary>stack trace details</summary><p>```javautilnosuchelementexception: javalangindexoutofboundsexception	at javautilabstractlist$itrnext(abstractlistjava:377)

issue somewhere in the entry list code and you just found a way to trigger them in fact such issues have been reported before we just didnt had a way to reproduce themso i would propose you push your changes to this pr we merge and then have a look at the exception later || i kinda forgot about merging/pushing sorry about that if further changes/improvements are required/preferred let me know || looks very good although i maybe make some little rewordings before merging this to fit to the name conventions of jabref! thank you!maybe well reorganize the preferences soon there is already another pr in waiting with a preferences option that would fit in this tab || 
7455,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,unmerge lo citations implemented "unmerge citations" in the openoffice/libreofficeintegration panel 7454( - go through the list below if a task has been completed mark it done by using ``- please dont remove any items just leave them unchecked if they are not applicable-->-  change in `changelogmd` described in a way that is understandable for the average user (if applicable)-        no tests were not created  do you have gui tests?      there is a known problem: "merge citations" does not save the information needed      to find the optional extra info (like page reference) stored in document properties      when reestablishing the individual references in uncombinecitemarkers      getuniquereferencemarkname() may or may not return the original name      when it does not the extra info may be lost or even taken from another entry      a solution could be to encode the number making the originals unique      in the merged name: in stead of  "jr_cite_1_xx2000ayy2010" it would be eg      "jr_cite_1_xx2000a1_yy2010" apart from construction and parsing       probably marking (or calulating) the originals as "in use" for getuniquereferencemarkname()       would be needed       another problem: combinecitemarkers orders the merged entries by year  (i am not sure why)       the original order is lost       in summary the presented solution although improves the situation does not cover       all aspects-  -   (for ui changes)![jabref-unmerge-citations](  [](  if not created an issue at < or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository does not mention the "merge citations" buttonthe most appropriate addition would probably go under the "known issues" sectiondescribing the two problems above (or the original if the proposed changes are not applied) thanks for your contribution  codewise looks good to me so fari think it would make sense to change the cite generation to encode the unique thing when combining but then the parse ref names needs to be adjusted as well and many other cases as well || > i think it would make sense to change the cite generation to encode the unique

which may seem or turn out to be superfluoussince i am editing while trying to understand what is going oni am worried that with so many changes i end up withsomething that will not be merged due to the amount of changesplease let me know what to expect and what to watch out for || probably the best would be to merge this one and you keep working on your branch but try to focus on one issue

sorry but i disagree with all of your suggestions and prefer the current jabref code style @jabref/developers 1 it is better to keep params short so you could also extract the long param to a var2 totally agree with the given rationale why inner braces should not be used your case to restrict use of vars should be a rare exception and youre better of to extract that into a function then3 might look nice but leads to a lot of refactorings when you add a new assignment we wanted to kep the number of "unrelated" line changes in diffs low to make it easier to review prs4 of course only a preference but we stick with the standard java code style here to add the brace in the same line might be too restrictive in oyur example but also here we tried to keep the number of rules low and simple without exceptions || > im sorry but i disagree with all of your suggestions and prefer the current jabref code style @jabref/developersit is ok i do not expect or suggest to change jabref code

i mean i try to remove this constraint and allow users to create groups with identical names if they wish so> but something as "group a (dup)" as a workaround doesnt seem to bad does this work? is it already sufficient?well for my purposes of using jabref no it is not sufficientthe primary need is to allow identical group names in different parts of the hierarchy without this i just can not use the groups of example i can not migrate automatically my bibliographies from zotero where i do have identical group names in different parts of the tree and migrating our old jabref 3x group assignment is also not possiblethe fact that two groups with the same name always get the same entries is for me an u ticipated feature which can be put to good use once you understand it actually think about groups not as tree leaves but as _sets_ in a mathematical sense a set (group) is defined by its members and the same set can be a member of any other sets (eg branches of a tree)if i need to define a special group of a different kind then ill probably find it too complicated to maintain and will not do it think what happens when i rename your primary group (group a)? all my symlink keyword based groups (group b and friends) will become invalid unless jabref fixes them automatically and how does it know when to fix keyword groups and when not? most often when i change a keyword in an entry this means that it must appear in a different keyword group not that the original keyword group is retargetted to a new keyword || > what should happen if the user renames one of the groups? if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no itemsalso removing a group should leave entries assigned to the group if other instances of the same group exist i can take care of this as well || im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some cases on the other hand it feels like opening a (small) box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about: renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions (say id-based or full-path-of-group) since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a "group name > group in tree" map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future mainte ce im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib file @jabref/developers what do you think? || > im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some casesvery much so!> on the other hand it feels like opening a (small) box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about: renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file it seems to be not that bad actually less dangerous than having full paths in group namesthe mentioned actions seem to make a "closed complete set of functions" (crud?):1 renaming a group is pretty much as it is now extension will be: if another group with the same name exists leave the old group name in all entries and add the new group name if the group was unique: remove old group name from entries add new group name to these entries very natural no information is lost the action is actually reversible! the user can later rename the new group again move it in the tree or "weed out" some entries (without affecting the original group)2 deleting the group is very similar to renaming: if another group with the same name exists no entries need to be changed otherwise group name is removed from all entriesim now experimenting with this functionality in my branch and will add modifications for 1) and 2) to the pr3 moving in the tree: trivial as it is now: just change the position in the list and the indentation number can be done both in gui and by editing/sed-editing the bibtex file4 manually editing of the groups tree: trivial – just delete one row and insert it in another position if yo want it elsewhere this is how i produced the test cases with identical groups before the patch of this pr was implemented tree editing is independent from entry editing unless you want to rename the group manually *and* retain all entries in it5 editing groups in entries: exactly as it is now just add a group name you want and you have added the entry to that named group it will appear in all places of the tree where this group is mentioned the entry editing is independent from the treeno dangers seem to be lurking so far> also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions (say id-based or full-path-of-group) since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a "group name > group in tree" map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future mainte cethe most painful migration was from groups 3x to groups 4 where a lot of people (including me :( ) lost their group assignment data well my day was saved by a subversion repo where all my databases reside and a bunch of unix scripts that restored the group assignments others might have been less luckyi see the group assignment by people to be a *very* valuable information – a lot of manual work went into assigning and classifying entries and people rely on them when finding information they need quicklyso an information-preserving migration strategy will be needed anywaya possible migration would be:1 when migrating from the current pr #7558 to a tree where groups in different tree branches are different:    -- if the new format supports  the "linked" groups ie groups that all get the same entries when an entry is added to one of them convert synonymous groups to such entries   -- if the new format does *not* support such functionality just retain groups with identical names and identical sets of entries and warn the user that the behaviour of jabref has changed2 when migrating from the old group format (3x) to the new one as in this pr:    -- if all groups have unique names nothing needs to be changed    -- if some groups in different places of the tree have the same name make only those groups unique by either appending a group parent names (as in treatment (medicine > asthma) and treatment (biocompatibility > surfaces) or by appending just a serial number and warn the user about renaming the user can then adjust group names if they wish but must importantly their precious division of entries into groups is not lost> im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib filewell even if i go for this i (and my colleagues) need some reassurance that jabref will keep the present functionality in the future so that our work of adding these groups and assigning entries to them does not go down the drain and keeping such functionality in sight is probably as much work for the jabref team as keeping it with the suggested changes added :)also if i need to use external scripts/editors for managing my bibtex file well its doable but i lose some integration and the nice jabref features like auto-fetch of bibliographies and oa papers would be a pity also it does not seem like a good advertisement for a gui program to say "well you of course can have this feature but you need to save data open a text editor edit groups by hand (watch out the syntax!) restart/reread the data into jabref"> @jabref/developers what do you think?keen to hear the answers!
