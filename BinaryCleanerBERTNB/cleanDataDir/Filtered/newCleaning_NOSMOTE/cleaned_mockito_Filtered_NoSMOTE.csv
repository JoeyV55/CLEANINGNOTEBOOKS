ourdependency on hamcrest we should remove mockitohamcrestin response to friendly ping on this pr i will submit this pr next week if there are no objections there were no objections so i am merging this sorry im late here i suggest we dont deprecate it the use case as documented in the javadoc is the following hamcrest integration is provided so that users can take advantage of existing hamcrest matchers that use case is still valid perhaps the docs need to be clearer to address for code that does not use hamcrest users should be following standard non hamcrest argthat apihope that helps for code that does not use hamcrest users should be following standard non hamcrest argthat apithe problem is that this project requires hamcrest as compile time dependency to be built this is a problem for users who do not want to use hamcrest but still build the source code as they cant use the pre built jars if we want to keep supporting hamcrest users with this api i would suggest a mockito hamcrest artifact that takes care of the integration that way those users who do not want to use hamcrest dont rely on it as wellwdyt im novice to testing because i have to wear many hats and i avoided getting into it like the plague in the past returning to spring development in my career and discovering mockito this year changed my integration testing life i rely heavily on googling stack overflow examples until it become memorized if ever i do it seems like there is a much larger documented wealth of knowledge on hamcrest on stack overflow maybe cause its been around a long time and so its easy to find solutions to basic challenges while someone new to mockito gets used to itfor example hasentry from this so helped me today like timvdlippes suggestion because it leverages giving your users the ability to tap into that knowledge solutions while slimming down the dependencies for the core mockito code basethanks for all your contributions in this area and letting us stand on your shoulders thanks for that response mansours i will look into introducing a mockito hamcrest artifact and figure out a way forward tomorrow i can revert this pr given the points raised by mockitoguy and make that work this is a problem for users who do not want to use hamcrest but still build the source code as they cant use the pre built jars can you elaborate this problem we use compileonly dependency for hamcrest just like we do for junit or opentest j this should not cause problems for consumers yes we are facing the same issues with junit and opentest j junit is not an issue atm as we are also using it but opentest j is currently an issuewe are not able to include jars as we require source code to be included and built for security analyses thus the inclusion of the dependencies during compile time does lead to problems when we want to build mockito in isolationi am currently investigating solutions for junit and opentest j and how that could be decoupled i went ahead with this pr as it was my understanding with mockito is that we wanted to remove our dependency of hamcrest therefore i assumed that deprecation was appropriate especially as there were no objections posted on this pr for almost weeks i understood that this was okayi will revert the pr for us to revisit but i would like to come to a decision on our hamcrest support and whether we want to support it or not at all when we come to a decision i would like to update our javadoc and wiki on that to clarify that for our users especially as there were no objections posted on this pr for almost weeks i understood that this was okayof course thank you for waiting weeks dont block on us yes we are facing the same issues with junit and opentest j junit is not an issue atm as we are also using it but opentest j is currently an issuecan you elaborate the problem is it a google mono repo use case i dont object reworking the artifacts i want understanding for me and others can you elaborate the problem is it a google mono repo use case i dont object reworking the artifacts i want understanding for me and others this is for every repository that includes third_party code that we need to have the original source code for security analyses that includes the mono repository as well as some other repositories that we havesince the hamcrest api is not type safe as it requires casting with object vs t as argument type we would like to move away from unsafe type casts the argumentmatcher interface does not inherit that problem but the older hamcrest api doesby having the hamcrest compatible api in the mockito artifact users can still use mockito in combination with the hamcrest apii would personally say that while the hamcrest api was originally useful for defining reusable matchers the lack of type safety does more harm than good i have received good responses when i finished the migration of the argumentmatcher to be typed and it already caught bugs in our tests i think we should promote the type safe argumentmatcher and thus deprecate the old api but happy to disagree on that part and leave hamcrest compatibility in for example a separate artifact that we need to have the original source code for security analysesso the problem is that in addition to mockito source you have to pull in hamcrest source for the analysis i still dont feel i fully understand this use case by having the hamcrest compatible api in the mockito artifact users can still use mockito in combination with the hamcrest apithats a fair argument leave hamcrest compatibility in for example a separate artifactto keep backwards compatibility we would need mockito core mockito hamcrest are you thinking of reversing the dependency in future major version revert of this pr is in so the problem is that in addition to mockito source you have to pull in hamcrest source for the analysis i still dont feel i fully understand this use case correct since jars can be built with any arbitrary code we prefer to not check in a jar as we cant be certain that it was built from the original source code thats why we check in the original source code and build that instead to keep backwards compatibility we would need mockito core mockito hamcrest are you thinking of reversing the dependency in future major versionyes but since maven does not allow a cyclic dependency we have to figure out what the possibilities are
