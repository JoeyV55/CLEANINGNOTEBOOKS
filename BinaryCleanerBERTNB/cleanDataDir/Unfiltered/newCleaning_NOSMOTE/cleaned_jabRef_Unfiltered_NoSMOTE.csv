time the problem herein lies that when the first entry is undone the insertion in the database triggers the creation and insertion of an namedcompund into the undomanager which kills the main undo the one with the multiple entries which result in just one entry being undonewith this workaround each entry has its own namedcompund which solves the problem but the user has to call the undoaction several times ctrl z for each entry x change in changelogmd described x changes in pull request outlined what why tests created for changes x tests green im unsure whether this is the correct behavior if i delete multiple entries at once all of them should be restored i thought that the undo redo concept of jabref is that always undo and redo actions are packaged as a wholeis it a valid workaround to globally flag whether an redo undo action is in progress and thus no new undo thing is put on the undo stack i would also prefer that the undo stuff is fixed so restoring several bibentries works but good that you found out the reason for the failing multiple entries ok ill look further into it and search for a better solution bartsch dev can you point me to the code where the insertion adds a new change in the undomanager as far as i see the revert action just calls databaseinsert which does not call the undo manager thanks when an entry is about to being restored undoableremoveentryundo https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java net sf jabref gui undo undoableremoveentryjaval is calledthe entry is inserted back into the database which fires a databasechangeevent https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java net sf jabref model database bibdatabasejaval and calls specialfielddatabasechangelistenerdatabasechanged databasechangeevent e https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java net sf jabref specialfields specialfielddatabasechangelistenerjaval and adds another edit into the undomanager if we follow that trail we see that the undomanager trims the edits line which calls die line and kills the namedcompound which contains the other entries we havent undone yet i wonder whether it is a solution to add a second paramter to insertentry indicating whether the action should be a silent change or not or add a second method insertentrysilently thank you bartsch dev for you helpful explanation i think the cleanest way is to remove the specialfielddatabasechangelistener and let the calling code handle the undo management ie if i call databaseinsert then i also have to create the undo event there otherwise we have problems everywhere with handling multiple changes undo an import i think this strategy is also applied everywhere else at least the group interface handles the undo thing itselfbut maybe you come up with another solution when removing the specialfielddatabasechangelistener it should be taken care that the special fields still work currently the fields are stored in the keyword field and are put into normal fields to enable rendering in the table if the specialfielddatabasechangelistener is removed this rendering imho wont take place any morewhen we rewrite the special fields https githubcom koppor jabref issues this might change another working solution i found was to create a new undoableedit which manages multiple entries with a list when undoing the removal it uses the new addentries method inside bibdatabase which adds all the entries and after that finally fires the databasechanges koppor tobiasdiez wdyt as i explored deeper into the code i noticed that the undo which the specialfielddatabasechangelistener adds doesnt do anything basically its an empty namedcompund which gets discarded by the undomanager can that confirm anyone currently without code here but double check that the stars in the columnrating are displayed in all undo cases deleting adding an entry is ok butwhat about undo redo of adding keyword rank in the keyword field myfeeling is that undo redo if that wont work when the updatelistener ischangedalso if an entry with keyword rank is added is the column rankingupdated to show one star the specialfielddatabasechangelistener https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java net sf jabref specialfields specialfielddatabasechangelistenerjaval only reacts on the insertion of entrieson another note when changing the rank of an entry you have to click into the entry list to repaint it but i think there was opened an issue on that a short time ago i deleted the specialfielddatabasechangelistener and adjusted l nas far as i can tell

synchronization is a code which is not that straight forward as other code in jabref i personally like the functionality to have columns shown which are based on keywords i made the reason might be

object in specialfielddatabasechangelistener https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java net sf jabref specialfields specialfielddatabasechangelistenerjaval is not usefulmostly because its

i noticed that assertj is simply to fast for jabref meaning that the entry table after opening the database is simply not loaded and thus cannot be found by increasing the delay between events from assertj robot settings delaybetweenevents it can be averted but i dont like it that way as it depends on the power of the executing machinei will look further into it tomorrowyou can revert the merge if you like that way we can have a clean commit without a mess in between the test seems to fail randomly making it stable enough is fine for me bartsch dev have you tried using robot waitforidle this should wait until the ui loaded the table without defining a timeout that slows the tests down on faster machines that doesnt worka simple solution was to open an empty table at the very beginning that way the loaded database opens without delayill open a new pr in a second

trouble to hide the developer information the css file probably needs some changes i tried to set the visibilty but that didnt work out tobiasdiez do you have some tips to handle this sorry for my later answer normally you do this by using a pseudoclass inactive and change it with pseudoclassstatechanged see for example https githubcom jabref jabref pull filesdiff a c dd caeeb e e eebb adb b r then you can style them via list cell active and list cell inactive i would however only use the pseudoclasses for real styling purposes for example list cell error shows an error icon and sets the font color to red filtering should really happen on the basis of the viewmodel to which the listview binds as you have done it right now for debugging ui issues the tool scenic view is very helpful http fxexperiencecom scenic view i had some problems with running it separately and bind it to jabref however adding it to the dependencies project structure modules dependencies add and then invoke scenicviewshow scene somewhere works tobiasdiez i have created filterlist to filter messages but i have one problem to view correctly entries in listview have a look at my screenshot it only runs correctly if entries run out of the listview i have created a test button to test this behavior this test button generates entry in systemout throws exception and generates entry in the cache this will be removed latercan you help me and tell me why listview doesnt displays the entry correctly notcorrectview https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets e d d ee e e dfbef af png sorry but i dont understand where your problem is it looks like it prints the test cache message as well as the first line of the error stack trace the systemout is ignored as i would have expected since you hide low priority messages hi tobiasdiez so i will explain you what is my problem the listview shoulds show you all log entries and other entries like systemout and exception if the button development information disable if the button on click it shoulds hide all systemout and exception entries i have handle this will a filterlist but the behavior by showing of entries is not correct reproduct start error console click on test button time or more times click on development information button click on this again if you do so like i have written then you will understand my problem sorry about my bad english i hope that you understand what i mean i need you help or some tipp how i can clear this problem thx you thanks for the additional description i added a comment to errorconsoleviewmodel which should help you to solve the problem for the next time please try to add some tests first there were quite a few things which could have been wrong are the messages correctly passed to the t stream do they have the correct priority is filtering of the list working properly and finally is is just a problem with the way how messages are displayed in the list viewthe first options could have been ruled out by automatic tests it would be good if you could add corresponding tests which also require some positve refactoring like making filteredlist a public class variable and moving its initialization to the constructor there are three solution for this problem with create issue function solution using of a github api to create issue directly from jabref with log in data which user not like to do it but i think that way will be nice solution and github will get more member take a look in create issue dialog screenshot from customer it will be nice this solution with a default account but it will be not work create issue with github api https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets cece a e d b c e eepng solution using oauth to create issue directly from jabref without log in data but the user must give the application access in their account to use it that will be difficult for some user solution this is my actual implement solution create issue over default browser with help of saved log and exception information in clipboard take a look in create issue pop up screenshot create issue with default browser https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets aabf e b a b png after close or click on ok button the default browser will open and show create issue site with default title automatic bug report current time with this format yyyymmddhhmmss and a default issue description jabref version operating system version java version during the show of this create issue site the log and exception information will be saved in clipboard so the user can be paste it for detail information in issue description take a look in create issue in default browser with paste detail information screenshot new issue https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets f a bf e fc a eb png which one did you implement i really like the copied to clipboard solution its simple yet effective can you please post a new screenshot of the actual lookedit and could you please test the look on hidpi screenstoo this is the new look of error console dialog errorconsoledialog https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets e bc ad e d a b bepng with button developer information it will show you the exceptions and outputs if it is existyou can copy the log and create issue directly from errorconsole edit i have test it on display with x i think that it is all okay please fix this bug when you activate the developer information button and then click copy log the exceptions will get hidden even though the developer information toggle button is still active pressing the developer information button twice will show the exceptions again please update your screenshots please fix bug open the developer information console click show developer information toggle button to show exceptions click ok button open the developer information console developer information toggle button is now deactivated again but the list view still shows the exception and the colour of the exception is black instead of red any idea for a better icon as pointed out in there is much more information than just errors here it might even be better to skip the icon what about the information icon some suggestions i would use the console image https mdnmozillademosorg files web console commandline highlightedpng instead of the red error symbol also move it above the list and add some description left to it in spirit we now give you an insight into the inner workings of jabrefs brain this might help to diagonize the root of problems please use the button below to inform the developers about an issue rename create issue to report issue move copy log button to the left to group it with the other buttons there rename ok to close do we really need a way to hide errors and warnings i think every log entry should be shown to the user ie no developer information button i know you spent a lot of time to implement it but i just dont see any advantages in having such a button add a small non obtrusive icon in front of every line which indicates if it is an error warning info similar to https mdnmozillademosorg files web console commandline highlightedpng some minor remarks and a bigger one with the icons once they are fixed im fine with thisall in all i really like how the console looks now good job 👍 tobiasdiez i have merged and done feedback thanks for the update the code looks better now i have just a few more remarks then this can be merged koppor pls do the final review tobiasdiez koppor feedbacks are done only this teestream thing i am not sure how to fix it 😄 maybe someone else from jabref stupro can help bartsch dev maybe its a kind of architectural decision try to use streameavesdropper instead of teestream tobiasdiez is this what you meant with moving the code to the streameavesdropper yes this looks betterso now i had a look at the code if i understand it correctly then there already exist two ways of listen to logger messages guiappender listens to everything which goes through the log j api ie loggerlog and writes it to cache streameavesdropper listens to everything which goes through the system streams systemout err and writes it to some streamsand you added logmessages listens to everything and writes it some some internal listcould you refactor the code so that everything is only written ̀to the internal list of logmessages ie get rid of the cache class and the printstreams in streameavesdropper and please add code comments to the classes it was hard to understand what they actually do appendum for myself since there is essentially no code which still uses systemout errprintln i would actually try to get rid of the streameavesdropper completely only problem uncaught exceptions are not written via the log j interface but this could be solved by setting the default handler http stackoverflowcom a tobiasdiez i have refactored and have done feedback hope it will be merged this time 😄

always at the right on tab change the tab gets updatedthe autocomplete is bound to the current tab maybe extend this one in another pr the old global search opening all findings in a new window is gone do we really need it jabref_globalsearch https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets b f fc ab e d e b d cpng x change in changelogmd described tests created for changes x screenshots added for bigger ui changes good work 👍 i am really happy that you are working on this is it correct that the global search window will be abandoned i have no idea whether it is causing any conflict with the current implementation of the search mechanism but i am one of those who is using it rather extensively there are two scenarios where a global search is useful often i create a separate bib file for a project eg a journal article where i put all related papers some of them are of interest just for this project and are not supposed to be part of my database core eg newspaper articles hence i often use search queries that include results of the core and project related file i have a bib file for papers which i use in a certain context but that havent been read thoroughly yet some of them will eventually be moved to the core database also in this case i use a global search to find results within both bib filesboth scenarios could be managed by creating groups and if global search gets abandoned i will certainly do however i like the tab based style of several bib files very much because i dont have the feeling that my project related articles get lost in my huge database with thousands of entries for keeping the global search window please readd it bartsch dev there are many jabref users having more than bib files they do not want to click through all files for each search another aspect what happens if the horiztonal space is not enough to display all icons and the search bar will the searchbar be displayed beneath the icon bar based on another issue the minimum width of the window is already around pixels depending on look an feel os etc so it is crucial that it will foldbut it indeed looks promising if the window is too small for the toolbar it will now wrap between the normal buttons and the searchbarthe search result dialog will now remember its location the global search has a shortcut ctrl shift f enter in the result dialog will select the entry in the basepanel the reuslt window is cloasable with ctrl w if fdocused https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment and the result dialog wont stay at top anymore if the mainframe is focused and they are on top of each other please resolve conflicts enter in the result dialog will select the entry in the basepanel i have two databases open and search for a keyword i open the global search and it finds my result entries from both databases i press enter on an entry and it focuses the correct tab but it always selects the first entry in this tab edit it does focus the correct entry if i am already in the right tab but if it has to focus a different tab it always selects the first entrydid i missunderstand the sentence or is this a bug should be fixed now is it possible to work on the global search in this pr too x the shortcut ctrl shift f should focus the search field if it is empty instead of doing a globally searching the empty string x esc in the global search should focus the search field currently the focus just stays where it was x the global search popup should show the bib file name implemented all things what happens if the window is too small will the search bar be moved to the new line a lot of people use jabref only with x resolution yes if the width is too small the entire searchbar will move into a new line what ive done so far searchbar instead of each bib database having its own the searchbar is now in the toolbar if the window width is too small the whole searchbar will move into a new line added shortcut global search ctrl shift f if the search field is empty it focus the searchbar fixed when searching the first match will be selected if the current selection is no match searchresultwindow the window will now remember its location each entry now shows which bib file it belongs to when the user closes the window without selecting an entry the searchbar is focused when the user double clicks on an entry it will correctly be selected in the bib file enter will select the entry in the bib file added shortcut closing the window ctrl w https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment the result window wont stay on top anymore the main frame is focusedwhat do you think sounds good wink ill test it later and give you some feedback good job almost all your described functionality is working fine the exception is fixed when searching the first match will be selected if the current selection is no match this still is not working for me in filter modesome ideas for further improvments the database column in the result window should be longer the current width is determined by the word database and only the first characters of the filename is shown in windows re accessing the result window after switching the focus to another application is hard as it is not added to the windows task bar was no issue before as it was modal above the jabref main window im not sure whether it might be helpful to use a titled border to group the search related textfields buttons and labels see https docsoraclecom javase tutorial uiswing components borderhtml or maybe align the search stuff on the right side the exception is fixed when searching the first match will be selected if the current selection is no match this still is not working for me in filter modewhen no entry was selected at all the search wouldnt select a match it now does did you mean that the database column in the result window should be longer the current width is determined by the word database and only the first characters of the filename is shownthe database column is now as wide as the author column in windows re accessing the result window after switching the focus to another application is hard as it is not added to the windows task bar was no issue before as it was modal above the jabref main window the searchresultframe will now show in the taskbar you can focus it with the global search shortkey too or maybe align the search stuff on the right side i wanted to do that too but if i do that the toolbar is not wrapable anymore the exception is fixed when searching the first match will be selected if the current selection is no match this still is not working for me in filter mode when no entry was selected at all the search wouldnt select a match it now does did you mean thatas far as i understand you description of the fix always the first matching entry should be selected if the search if the currently selected entry is not a match of the search rightthis is working fine if the float mode is active but does not work in the filter mode the preview or entry editor is still showing the entry selected before performing the search which is not visible in the list of matches at all unbe nt https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets e f e e a

missing this feature in jabref however the current behavior is a little unexpected first the file seems to be moved relative to its current directory for example directory pattern \entrytype moves the file with every execution of cleanup to a new subdirectory for me expected behavior would be that the new path is relative to the directory of the bib file or some otherwise specified root directory second the file field in the bib entry seems to be adjusted only if the option use the bib file location as primary file directory is set otherwise the file is moved but the file path is not adjusted dierkes thanks for your feedback i would have asked you to test it otherwise too the moving files is a bit complicated as it has to be kept backwards compatiblethe file directory is the first found directory a global file dire from setting b bib file relative c bib specific setting atm not sure about the order b and c regarding the file field i will check it regarding the new file directory thats not the behavior i observedmy test case was original file phdthesis xyz_ pdf all paths relative to the bib file file name pattern \bibtexkeyfile dir pattern \entrytypecleanup phdthesis phdthesis

default directory for files was set i tried with setting it to the directory of the bib file i didnt try to set the default file directory for the specific bib file however can do that later from my perspective a backward compatible solution could be if the file dir pattern is not set rename the file in its current location if it is set move the file to the directory specified by file dir pattern relative to bib file directory if its a relative path and rename it there however an empty file name pattern could mean a rename the file in place or b move file to bib file directory so an additional option is probably necessary that specifies whether moving files is active or notinterpreting the file dir pattern as a path relative to the current directory of the file doesnt make sense to me since executing cleanup would always change the file path which is probably the opposite effect one expects from a cleanup ah i see you are rightwill look around gmt dierkes notifications githubcom

ajdzego bkoyc n tm c mviks q ushgajpzm jxp dierkes i fixed the strange behaviour there was some directory path which was just and not null so it was resolved to the current dir of the jar now it only renames the fileand the old behaviour now works too when filedirpattern is empty the file is moved to the file directory the file directories are checked in this order the settings are prioritized in the following order and the first defined setting is used metadata user specific directory metadata general directory preferences directory bib file directory this works almost i encountered a similar problem when dragging a file and dropping it to an entry when i select to move the file again instead of a file a directory is created same path as the file should have and another issue if multiple files are linked to an entry the first file is renamed and the other file links get lost in jabref the first file is renamed and the other files are moved to the same directory thanks for your intenstive testingthe issue with the drag and drop is now fixed there was a problem with the layout which would have been default to bibtexkey if the pattern param is emptyi am aware of the thing with the multi files as far as i discovered the first successful rename move exits the function will try to find out why not sure if i find time for it next weekaddtionally i will create some automatic tests too if it works finally i think i fixed the issue with the multiple files see the behavior now as far as i understand it is the function will try to move rename all attached files if a file with the new file path already exist that happens if two attached files have the same file extension it doesnt move rename the file and keeps the old file path in the bib entryfor example lets consider we have three attached files olddir oldname pdfolddir oldname pdfolddir oldname txtthe new file paths will be newdir newnamepdfolddir oldname pdfnewdir newnametxti think there is some room for improvement for example to keep oldname but move the file to newdir if possible however before doing this i think its necessary to define the desired behavior in detail thanks for your work just one

hidden no idea how to change it back settingsimportpanel https cloudgithubusercontentcom assets a ba cf e fa dbdefb ca bpng yeah finally the layout works sunglasses thanks for the work im really missing this feature in jabref however the current behavior is a little unexpected first the file seems to be moved relative to its current directory for example directory pattern \entrytype moves the file with every execution of cleanup to a new subdirectory for me expected behavior would be that the new path is relative to the directory of the bib file or some otherwise specified root directory second the file field in the bib entry seems to be adjusted only if the option use the bib file location as primary file directory is set otherwise the file is moved but the file path is not adjusted dierkes thanks for your feedback i would have asked you to test it otherwise too the moving files is a bit complicated as it has to be kept backwards compatiblethe file directory is the first found directory a global file dire from setting b bib file relative c bib specific setting atm not sure about the order b and c regarding the file field i will check it regarding the new file directory thats not the behavior i observedmy test case was original file phdthesis xyz_ pdf all paths relative to the bib file file name pattern \bibtexkeyfile dir pattern \entrytypecleanup phdthesis phdthesis xyz_ pdfcleanup phdthesis phdthesis phdthesis xyz_ pdfcleanup phdthesis phdthesis phdthesis phdthesis xyz_ pdfit didnt matter if use the bib file location as primary file directory was set or if the default directory for files was set i tried with setting it to the directory of the bib file i didnt try to set the default file directory for the specific bib file however can do that later from my perspective a backward compatible solution could be if the file dir pattern is not set rename the file in its current location if it is set move the file to the directory specified by file dir pattern relative to bib file directory if its a relative path and rename it there however an empty file name pattern could mean a rename the file in place or b move file to bib file directory so an additional option is probably necessary that specifies whether moving files is active or notinterpreting the file dir pattern as a path relative to the current directory of the file doesnt make sense to me since executing cleanup would always change the file path which is probably the opposite effect one expects from a cleanup ah i see you are rightwill look around gmt dierkes notifications githubcom

ajdzego bkoyc n tm c mviks q ushgajpzm jxp dierkes i fixed the strange behaviour there was some directory path which was just and not null so it was resolved to the current dir of the jar now it only renames the fileand the old behaviour now works too when filedirpattern is empty the file is moved to the file directory the file directories are checked in this order the settings are prioritized in the following order and the first defined setting is used metadata user specific directory metadata general directory preferences directory bib file directory this works almost i encountered a similar problem when dragging a file and dropping it to an entry when i select to move the file again instead of a file a directory is created same path as the file should have and another issue if multiple files are linked to an entry the first file is renamed and the other file links get lost in jabref the first file is renamed and the other files are moved to the same directory thanks for your intenstive testingthe issue with the drag and drop is now fixed there was a problem with the layout which would have been default to bibtexkey if the pattern param is emptyi am aware of the thing with the multi files as far as i discovered the first successful rename move exits the function will try to find out why not sure if i find time for it next weekaddtionally i will create some automatic tests too if it works finally i think i fixed the issue with the multiple files see the behavior now as far as i understand it is the function will try to move rename all attached files if a file with the new file path already exist that happens if two attached files have the same file extension it doesnt move rename the file and keeps the old file path in the bib entryfor example lets consider we have three attached files olddir oldname pdfolddir oldname pdfolddir oldname txtthe new file paths will be newdir newnamepdfolddir oldname pdfnewdir newnametxti think there is some room for improvement for example to keep oldname but move the file to newdir if possible however before doing this i think its necessary to define the desired behavior in detail thanks for your work just one

documentation status issue created for outdated help page at helpjabreforg https githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues if you changed the localization did you run gradle localizationupdate well since it was decided in the devcall to implement this it is ok for me if you go ahead regarding the choice of the tracking technology i trust your skills the code that is needed to track a dialog seems to be very simple in any casei am just not sure if an opt out is the way to go or if it should rather be an opt in maybe we could display a dialog asking for consent on first startup that would be more privacy friendly in my point of view and we do not want jabref to appear that it tries to grab user data i am sure there would be enough people who are willing to contribute their data even in case of opt in for opt in nice that you give it a try 😄 👍 ga had no appropriate library why do you want to spy almost everything i do grimes my guess i havent participated in the discussion on this is that this would enable us to see which features are actually used and which are not if we had had data on content selector usage we would not have removed them at the same time we would be able to see if there is a point at all in optimizing jabref usage for really large databases or if this is a waste of time i added tracking of other dialogs and changed the default to do not share telemetry data also after the first minute of using jabref the user is asked whether he wants to share is data i actually preferred to have a more non invasive notification similar to ie http mediaaskvgcom articles images speedup_browsing_disable_addons_popup_ie png javafx provides a notificationpanel exactly for this scenario however it doesnt work if the rest of the application is in swing anyway this pr is now finally ready for your feedback for later reference i will add this links also to the wiki walk through of how to use azure application insights in java https docsmicrosoftcom en us azure application insights app insights java get started azure application insight github project https githubcom microsoft applicationinsights java i tried it out locally the dialog appears as desired and the option can be disabled via the preferences code wise i have no objections however jabref does not terminate when i close it and i get the a lot of messages in the console eg ai trace telemetry configuration illegal instrumentation key nullai trace inprocesstelemetrychannel sending telemetryai error failed to send bad request {itemsreceived itemsaccepted errors {index statuscode message invalid instrumentation key} }ai trace telemetry configuration illegal instrumentation key nullai trace inprocesstelemetrychannel sending telemetryai error failed to send bad request {itemsreceived itemsaccepted errors {index statuscode message invalid instrumentation key} } since this is a very sensitive topic i think we should make the dialog a little more explanatory currently it says to improve the user experience we would like to collect data on the features you use no personal data will be collectedwhile everything is in that statement i think we should be more explicit and repeat ourselves suggestion to improve the user experience we would like to collect anonymous statistics on the features you use we will only record what features you access and how often you do it we will neither collect any personal data nor the content of bibliographic items the collected data will be stored on xxx and we will only use it to prioritize our development efforts if you choose to allow data collection you can later disable it via options preferences generali know this is quite long but since this is a delicate topic i think it is necessary btw where is the data actually stored jabref developers i think this is so important that everyone should consider it brieflyand a last comment we will get flack from the linux freaks when they find out that we dare to include a microsoft library so be prepared for it i like your suggestion for the dialog text and updated it accordingly the data is store on microsoft azure serverno idea where exactly 😄 the reason for the error message is that a correct instrumentation key is only inserted by travis and thus you get these messages when you run jabref from the ide by the way this is what i just got after installing soapui soapui

things with the metadata to make it compile again could you please have a look thanks how to handle the metadata is indeed a problem i remember that i removed the content selectors mainly because they were the last not so easy to convert to the new metadata item the next few days i will not find the time to assist you here sorry still some language related errors the localization keys existed before the feature was removed i wonder why the revert did not restore them in the language files i did a manual revert because there were some more changes which would have led to conflicts otherwisewas somehow decided as this was a rather old feature i suppose there were translations for most languages can you readd the translated values as well or should i go digging in the history 😉 so i re implemented parsing and serialization of content selectors and added tests for it it is probably not the most beautiful fashion but i need to want to link to the old code and not have to re write the gui speaking of the gui the content selectors seem to be working fine if the metadata is in the bib file the gui in the entryeditor is not actually beautiful but i guess it has never been does anybody feel like polishing the ui however i do not see options – manage content selectors maybe that has not been ported from yet maybe someone who is more familiar with the menu than me can have a look finally the test currently say netsfjabreflogichelphelpfiletest refertovalidpage failed although there seems to be a help page here http helpjabreforg en contentselector someone certainly

hopefully i directly edited it on github tobiasdiez indeed it does nice that means the feature is backregarding the help files there is content_selector contentselector in netsfjabreflogichelphelpfile so the test really should not fail should it ok seems we are back on track only the google scholar test is failing now which i hope is just a random connection problem on the side of travis the same might have applied for the help file testso now we can do some more code review and at a certain point have the users from try out the feature to make sure that it works tobiasdiez i addressed most of your comments i agree that content selectors is probably not the most appropriate name for the stuff this feature does but it is the name under which it has existed for a long time and is known at least by some people i would say that consistency in naming tops appropriateness of the namefurthermore i removed the entry editors update code as you asked for the updating of the content selectors did not even work with this code i tried to replace it with something else and failed so for now you have to restart jabref to get a change in the content selectors to work maybe someone from jabref developers can provide a hint on how the refresh of the entry editor should workfinally i will leave the problems in the localization for siedlerchr to fix closing and reopening of the entry editor does not work potentially with selecting another entry matthiasgeiger unfortunately not the changed data makes it into the metadata but the gui does not notice it is only up to date when the metadata is re read from disk and the entryeditor is re built closing and reopening the bib file does the trick or restarting jabref so we would like to get this into v which hopefully can be released in december what is missing correct the language files have selector keywords updated without reloading of the bib file have the users play around with it to see if it really worksi was hoping that siedlerchr could do the first two points and hopefully soon siedlerchr what is your opinion on that yeah i will try to work on it at least i tried to fix the language files yesterday i will continue working on it the weekend

search globalsearchbarjava cannot render html tobiasdiez recommended in to create a textflow object in the searchdescriber https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref logic search rules describer searchdescriberjava classes for structuring the text i made the changes to return a textflow and its working fine so far without changing the logic that is used to build the text i moved the searchrulesdescriber package like proposed from the logic package to the gui package the existing tests were moved accordingly but still needs to be rewritten for the new textflow resultsthere are some open questions i would like to ask with no styling of the tooltip the readability was really bad black text on grey background so i changed the styling to look like the other tooltips in the bar hope it was okay to do this in the context of this issue i created a new styleclass for this in the maincss to not change any other styled elements the searchquery https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref logic search searchqueryjava class stores a description of the search it is created with the searchdescribers but they are now inside the gui package and return a textflow so there is a javafx dependency in the searchquery class which resides in the logic package at the moment this doesnt sound right to me should the class be moved to the gui package too the groupdialog https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref gui groups groupdialogjava class uses a searchquery object to get a search description this class is written with swing and is not compatible to the now returned textflow if i understand it right the project is migrating to use javafx so i want to propose that i write a compatibility method in the groupdialog class to create an html string from the given textflow to be compatible while the groupdialog is still using swing sadly the localized strings used in the searchdescribers included the html tag elements so in many cases it is not possible to use existing translations just because the tags are gone im not sure what to do about this it could be possible to remove the tags manually from the translations not sure how long this would takethats how the tooltip looks with the changes screenshot https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c e cc e a b c c ac png there seems to be something wrong with the logic of the tooltip text creation the first few words repeat itself and it already happened prior to my changes see the image in but i didnt had time to look very closely into this should i open a new issue for this problemi hope i didnt forget anything im happy to hear your feedback x change in changelogmd described x tests created for changes x screenshots added for bigger ui changes x manually tested changed features in running jabref x check documentation status issue created for outdated help page at helpjabreforg https githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues x if you changed the localization did you run gradle localizationupdate first of all thanks for your contribution moving all logic code to gui seems like the only option here but in general should be avoided what about having a different approach keepiing all stuff string based in logic and in the gui you have a helper method for converting the html tags are only a few from the localization into the rtf equivalent and by adding it to a textflow i see no reason why this should not workif you look into the localization stuff you see there are only a couple of and tags so nothing really advanced https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main resources l n jabref_enproperties after thinking a little longer about the package problem i think the architecture is actually not right if the searchdescribers generate html code and stay in the logic package because html code is only usable in a gui use case and has not really anything to do with logic so maybe they were not really in the right package to begin with if their only purpose is to create a structured text for the guii think the searchquery objects should not hold a description stored if it is removed there is no further moving of classes necessary at the places the description member of searchquery is used it can be generated with the searchdescribers class like in the searchquery class at the momentimho the package structure would be most honored that wayit would save the translations if the searchdescriber creates an html string which can be converted later to a textflow like you said but if the project really is moving towards javafx it seems wrong to me to keep html strings for structuring text because in javafx this is the task of a textflow i would try to look into removing the html tags from the translations to not lose them and make a step forward using javafx also a big thanks from me i dont have much time at the moment so just a short remark concerning your point i think it should be possible to completely remove the description field from the searchquery class just expose the rule and query via getters and then call the ̀ searchdescriptorgetdescriptionfor every time you need the description in the gui in this way the description completely disappears from the logic package concerning you can also embed javafx controls in swing which is probably easier to do then creating a conversion to html status update i removed the description from the searchquery class so it can remain in the logic package i recreate an html string in the groupdialog class for compatibility was very easy this way modified the tests for the searchdescriber implementations to properly check the textflow description created tests for the utility class i creatednow there is only one problem left the broken localizationsi looked into the localization files and it could be possible to rescue a lot of translations by just manually deleting the html tags from the translations when they are at the beginning or end but in some cases after translating the text the tags are positioned in the middle of words there it would be necessary to create a new translation because im not able to just delete the tag from the beginning or endthe only other alternative i see is using the old html strings for the localization and then break them up and convert them into javafx texts imho this would be really ugly and not a good readable solutionwhat do you think any other possible solutions when i see it right you only need to replace the html tags for the search descriptions right so the rest of the translations can and should stay as it iscant it be possible to strip replace the tags on the fly so if i encounter a in my text i have to switch to bold face at that position sadly its not so simple with textflows they consist of multiple text objects and you can set the font on each text so if there is a string like this xxx xxx xxxx xx that translates into xx xxx xxx xx xxxxthen there are three text objects needed text xx xxx text xxx text xx xxxx i will try to find an acceptable abstraction so the code will not be completely unreadable and the old translations can be used so now the old strings are used and the localization is working again i tried to make it as readable as possible what do you think now any more things to do anything else i should have considered so i think i made all your requested changes it now looks like this with the new styling screenshot https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ea c d b e e b af png thank you very much for the quick follow ups and of course for your contribution in general we are looking forward to see more prs from you 😉 your welcome grin

style changes this improves the performance of from the second call to the preview drastically and should provide an acceptable speed to fix in addition i extended the search for citation styles when jabref is run during developmenti will add changelog and friends but for the moment my biggest problem is that the unit tests are broken on master at least for me x change in changelogmd described

https githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues if you changed the localization did you run gradle localizationupdate lenhard tobiasdiez thanks for the fast review here are to comments to lenhards first message in that case the configured citation style can be used but i cannot select a new one in the preferences dialog there the list is emptyyes i did not consider this case i assume the fat jar contains the styles still packed as jar im sure i can fix this then when trying to preview items i get exceptions but these exceptions happen reliably for certain bib items so it seems just like a bad combination of the randomly selected style i used for testing acm sig authors and the bib itemstook a while but i could pin it down im not sure i caught the exception before but now you will see cannot create preview and the exception appears in the log as usual the error comes from your bibentry when you look at your bibtex code you see month {december } if this is indeed valid bibtex then our csl converter does not handle it correctly you can find the json format https hastebincom udibubehiwjson of what orgjabreflogiccitationstylecsladapterbibentrytocslitemdata makes from your code its so short that you spot the error easily csl is choking on the invalid date partsas soon as you remove the days the item is rendered correctlythis error should have happened before as i did not touch that part im not sure how this can reliably be fixed as we only extract the latex free fields and turn them into strings that should probably be a different pr halirutan thanks for the investigation and i hope you did not waste too much time on that that is not correct bibtex well bibtex is very open and relaxed and of course you can write it in this way but this is not how the content of the month field is expected i just opened an old bib file and clicked around not caring too much about the actual data you can ignore that error in your pr herei think a viable strategy would actually be to absorb the exception completely exceptions in jabrefs log should indicate problems in jabref this is not a problem of jabref but of user data and the citation styles library therefore i think it would be sufficient to create a log entry stating that the attempt to parse an entry results in an error from the citation styles library but this can be part of a different pr things that need to work fast scrolling through the entry liest with preview open edit copy preview for single and many items on a selection right click and copy citation lenhard i cannot reproduce that the styles are not found with the fat jar can you try to delete and rebuild it and show exactly what you try i see all styles and i can switch them as usual the fat jar has the same structure as the normal jar with all styles included as files i am doing the following execute gradlew build cd to build libs execute java jar jabref devjar for some reason there is nothing available to select in the preview panel see picture although the csl files are contained in the fat jar not as a jar but as the single csl files right in the root of the jar the log says opening c \users\joerg\desktop\jl main\diss\tex\referencesbibsomething went wrong while adding the discovered citationstyles to the list preview https user imagesgithubusercontentcom bcdc de e ab e c d d fba aeapng furthermore i am

the rest stays the same no citation styles in the list my configuration is now jabref devwindows amd java _ i tested it and i found there is a problem with how you get the path will commit a fix halirutan lenhard i fixed the path handling and improved the code for searching inside the jar filefor me it works now when i directly run jabref main in eclipse 🙌 😃 siedlerchr can you point out what exactly went wrong with the path so that i dont make the mistake in the future otherwise nice clean up i removed your println i guess you simply forgot this and i renamed jarfs to jarfs to satisfy my spell check i like to have absolutely no warning if possible smiley lenhard can you test it again your approach is basically what i did too and here it worked

lenhard i completely agree we should find a way to have a realeasable version while still work on the migration to javafx the main problem is that the code is tightly coupled to the maintable ie there is no abstraction layer before the basepanel maintable that used in the other swing dialogs this has the potential upset that every single dialog may now trigger a bug for example because it runs some code not on the javafx thread so even through i will try to thoroughly test the new code before marking it as ready for review there might still be countless bugs left which we need to find and fix in teamwork moreover for the same reason i think we also need to release a beta againthat being said the immediate question is how much functionality should i try to migrate in this pr and what should follow as new prs as you said the size of the changes makes the pr already unreviewable but i would really like to have your feedback about some design questions especially since our aim should be not just to improve the gui but also decouple the code and make it more reusablecurrently the new maintable is in a state where the very basic functionality works and the code is decoupled enough to actually write unit gui tests for it there are still some bugs feature that definitely need to be fixed before a users touches it eg restore column width context menus for the icons a few display bugs then there are a few features that are not essential and rather isolated eg marking of entries these are probably good candidates for follow up prs and finally there are features that i dont really see any benefit in reimplementing eg coloring of table cells when the field is optional required or that are not really possible to implement with javafx eg float search https bugsopenjdkjavanet browse jdk finally the possible bug fixes lenhard mentions should also follow as new prsany thoughts on this sorry for the long text i think we could have a separate main table beta test release in an additional branch highly experimental and let some users test this functionality who are interested especially we would need some mac linux guys we can create a javafx branch where we can integrate not ready features but completed work packages such as a basic entry table in javafx the master branch must be release ready at all times release ready means all features of the old versions should be working or the dev team decided to remove disable a feature such as the auto completion so i used this version now in production during the past few days and fixed a lot of bugs although not all features are yet migrated see list above i mark this pr now as ready for review all further changes are coming as extra prs onto this branch i would suggest that you try this version out and if nothing serious pops up i would create a post in the forum advertising this pr and ask users about their opinion something like a very early access program instead of several beta releases what do you think i would be really cool if you could provide a table that lists all features related to the maintable that were present in the swing version eg sorting options right click options entry drop column sorting and could indicate if these features are working in the new version then we would have an overview of what features actually exist in the main table and we could have a meaningful discussion about which features we want to droppersonally i dont really have an overview of all the things that the maintable can do could you perhaps provide this overview i guess also koppor know a thousand maintable features that i do not know i changed the base branch to maintable beta i would propose to proceed as follows jabref developers review work in review comments merge into maintable beta ask users to feedback to maintable beta add new prs on maintable beta why i think prs should be short and be closed fast not left open as the ones of koppor so we can move on quickly and we can also link to comments of this pr if necessary the discussions here are mixed on the implementation details and overall issues i think we should focus on implementation details 😇 in case we need a overview pr we can create a pr from maintable beta to master and describe the overall status there i am very used to the floating search see screenshots at https githubcom jabref jabref issues lenhard i updated the first post to also include the features that are already migrated it is only the very basic functionality right now we do not need to decide what features should be dropped since there is still a lot fundamental functionality to migrate but we should speak about it in the next devcall i just dont want this pr to explode even more and get feedback about some of the other refactorings changes thus the early ready for review koppor sounds like a good plan i fixed the close entry editor with escape bug lenhard siedlerchr is this architecturally ok then i would propose to merge it into maintable beta to reduce the size of prsnote the real pr of getting this into jabref is https githubcom jabref jabref pull there code updates are only made as prs to that branch

nothing serious pops up i would create a post in the forum advertising this pr and ask users about their opinion something like a very early access program instead of several beta releases what do you think i would be really cool if you could provide a table that lists all features related to the maintable that were present in the swing version eg sorting options right click options entry drop

package while you are working on this you might also take a look at we could use the latex html converter and then convert that html formatting to the textflow which was done in the search component tooltips yes this issue is already fixed merely by switching to javafx the unicode is correctly displayed see above the second entry in the table the first screenshot shows the boxes while the correct string is shown in the second screenshot one more step in the right direction this pr has the potential to fix a lot of display bugs and we should be able to get rid of the annoying and unmaintained glazed lists librarynevertheless i need to add a word of caution we cannot allow the same situation as for the entry editor again weve spent almost half a year in un releaseable limbo because of that the replacement for the main table needs to be absolutely bullet proof however the amount of lines of code in this pr is too much for a meaningful review so we need a lot of manual testing by basically all developersive played around a bit and i like the new layout of the maintable whats a little strange is that every second row is highlighted differently this should change for the final version edit things that should be fixed with this pr https githubcom jabref jabref issuesqis aissue is aopen label amaintable siedlerchr thanks for the feedback ill improve the code accordingly lenhard i completely agree we should find a way to have a realeasable version while still work on the migration to javafx the main problem is that the code is tightly coupled to the maintable ie there is no abstraction layer before the basepanel maintable that used in the other swing dialogs this has the potential upset that every single dialog may now trigger a bug for example because it runs some code not on the javafx thread so even through i will try to thoroughly test the new code before marking it as ready for review there might still be countless bugs left which we need to find and fix in teamwork moreover for the same reason i think we also need to release a beta againthat being said the immediate question is how much functionality should i try to migrate in this pr and what should follow as new prs as you said the size of the changes makes the pr already unreviewable but i would really like to have your feedback about some design questions especially since our aim should be not just to improve the gui but also decouple the code and make it more reusablecurrently the new maintable is in a state where the very basic functionality works and the code is decoupled enough to actually write unit gui tests for it there are still some bugs feature that definitely need to be fixed before a users touches it eg restore column width context menus for the icons a few display bugs then there are a few features that are not essential and rather isolated eg marking of entries these are probably good candidates for follow up prs and finally there are features that i dont really see any benefit in reimplementing eg coloring of table cells when the field is optional required or that are not really possible to implement with javafx eg float search https bugsopenjdkjavanet

parameterized tests are not executed on the junit travis build this is tracked here i think this is a huge problem because we are missing out on a lot of validation here this pr is a migration of the paramterized ris tests from junit to junit id like to put this forward to discussion so that we can agree on how our parameterized junit tests are to look like when we have agreed we can migrate all tests so please look at the code and write if you are happy with this note that parameters cannot be resolved for lifecycle methods http junitorg junit docs current user guide writing tests

tested changed features in running jabref check documentation status issue created for outdated help page at helpjabreforg https githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues tobiasdiez thanks a lot for the feedback regarding test arguments i dont really see the point in splitting the single argument into two we have used the convention that the bib and importerformat files have the same name and why not keep leveraging that also i find it better to do the path conversion in one place only but if we want to pass a stream of paths we always have to do that beforehand regarding unification of importer tests i have refactored around a little and arrived at a solution that should work for all importers i quite like how that condenses the risimportertestfiles classfun fact i may have used junit paramterization but so far the assertions were still junit ill change that in the following the importer tests where running for each file but that seems to have been ignored in the migration process by the junit compi looked at this too but didnt find a way to get it to work again yes indeed ill gradually go through all parameterized importer tests and try to get them working in junit syntax again as part of this pr turns out quite a lot of tests for different importers bibtexml medline tested so far actually fail and this is down to the implementations of the importers seems like these tests have never been executed beforei am not sure what to do about this here the point of this pr was a refactoring of the testing code not a repair of broken importers i would merge this if all tests are at least executed or better you merge this in a new branch where we will fix the importer then i converted and fixed some fetcher tests in another pr i found that the gvk test would also be a goo candidate for using the same schema as here i have now migrated the complete importer tests to junit syntaxsadly they are in a dire state a lot of them are actually failing and seemed to have never been executed anyway and even except from the refactorings that i have already done there as a lot of things that can still be improvedi think its best if we take the current failing state and try to repair each importer and its tests here in the pr this might be some work but the importer tests cannot really continue as broken as they are now help on this is very much appreciated and should be possible without conflicts you can ignore the failing fetcher test this is already fixed but i wonder why there is now an npe with the method source i should have more meetings so that i get more programming done i think i have repair all importers and their tests now ill see what travis says and ill also do one more round of refactoring on the code not now when i am done this can hopefully be merged lgtm if you merge master in your branch you will get the fetcher test fixed as well ok this can be merged from my point of viewalthough this is already a huge refactoring of the existing tests theres certainly more that can be improved i have a few things in mind but i would rather keep them out of this already big pr ill tackle them later when this is merged that looks weird indeed looking at the first one https codecovio gh jabref jabref src migrate parameter tests src main java org jabref logic importer fileformat bibtexmlimporterjava the importdatabase method is recorded as not covered but when i execute the tests in intellij there are twenty test files for that method alone the key seems to be that the missing methods are the ones that use junit parameterized tests it seems that codecov does not record the coverage of these tests but they are the core tests of the whole packagebut maybe the problem is still travis how do i see from our travis output that the tests are really executed i can push a failing test deliberately but there surely is a better way since the travis log contains statement like main warn orgjabreflogicmsbibmsbibdatabase could not parse documenti suppose the tests are correctly invoked in fact the travis log exploded even more probably there is a problem with the gradle task jacocojunit testreport but there is no need to fix this in this pr i would merge this in and i think tthere might be a solution for the reports https githubcom junit team junit issues

going a little more and taking inspiration from i took the liberty to extend the toolbar with more buttons herethis is really not meant as a final say it just moves the code in place for some buttons that seem of some value for me they can be removed again resorted and the layout is probably also not perfectheres a screenshot toolbar https user imagesgithubusercontentcom af e e b dee png change in

the mysql fans i really need the two buttons for the shared database if a connection to a mysql is established in the current database 😇 not for postgresql and oracle database koppor i find two actions in the code standardactionsconnect_to_shared_db and standardactionspull_changes_from_shared_db so if a connection to mysql database is established you want both of these buttons to show and otherwise just the pull push button oh only the second that is needed for mysql only the former one is not needed at all currently no clue what it is useful for decision in devcall separate social network buttons from the rest add tracking for user actions and evaluate in the future which buttons should be displayed lenhard an fyi from me and please dont feel pressured you might have seen that i want to make a consistent layout for all panels toolbars etc issue here https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment im going to wait with this until your pr here is pushed then i will merge the maintable beta again into my local branch and incorporate all changes i really would like to have more icons on the toolbar to get a better feeling for the look i grabbed the template from the material design icons and started to convert some of the icons we dont have in this style as an example emacs texstudio and vim emacs https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c c dd e b ddf png texstudio https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c be dd e ddf f ac c png vim https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c a abf dd e f fd e fce d png would it be of interest if i pursue this further if yes does someone know if we can include them as a vector font so that we have those icons scalable to whatever resolution we need im worrying about retina displays or other k devices where x let alone x icons look not good halirutan i would suggest you contribute that upstream read more at https githubcom templarian materialdesign blob master contributingmdthere are also the academic icons https jpswalshgithubio academicons however there is none for tools but some for dois pubmed koppor i might be wrong but the readme there reads in its final paragraph please note that at this time the only brand icons we accept requests for are popular social media sites apps and widely used products software thanks for understandingin fact i have searched for vim and emacs on the site first and was stunned that such widely used apps cannot be found it doesnt matter i have successfully searched for a way to create our own ttf font for the icons in this way we can stay consistent with our design and we can adjust the icons as we like halirutan i would agree that emacs and vim are widely used in case there is no pr yet why not creating a pr i have to admit that other software is not that popularmaybe we should start another font project maybe we fit into the academic icons https jpswalshgithubio academicons at least i would try 😇 thus also the latex users would benefit from your work https ctanorg pkg academicons why not forking academic icons and proposing our latex related to them edit regading vim and emacs you might find them here https githubcom ryanoasis nerd fonts edit they also provide a font patcher i think there is no real need to use a font based icon svg images can be included more easily in javafx than font based icons like this https githubcom jabref jabref blob f c cafadeb ec f cd src main java org jabref gui iconthemejaval l the only exception is if the font can be accessed via fontawesomefx https bitbucketorg jerady fontawesomefx overview tobiasdiez i havent looked at this to be honest what about scaling for some icons we set the size by giving the font size like in the entryeditorcss tool bar glyph icon { glyph size px fx font size em} can we achieve consistent sizes when we use partly svg icons i mean i see that we used px here but will this be the same when not used as a font good point the file based icons are shown using https githubcom jabref jabref blob f c cafadeb ec f cd src main java org jabref gui iconthemejaval l imageview does provide some scale mechanisms but these are probably not accessible via css in general i agree that a font based solution is desirable my comment should just serve as a warning that it might be not so easy to include an arbitrary font as icon sources and it may be easier to include the svg directly hi all thanks for the comments i am currently in the process of relocating myself and my family to another country as you can imagine i dont have any free time on my hands so please dont expect action here soon if this blocks progress somewhere else i have no problem if someone else takes over and rounds this off of course no problem lenhard since the only thing missing in this pr is the additional push to shared icon i merge now im looking forward to see more prs incoming as soon as your pc is relocated

junit and as far as i know this version has not been released yetfor citekeybasedfilefindertestjava i havent found an extension in junit for the mockitojunitrunnerclass in junit and it seems that their mock official version hasnt been release yet too the database test as i can see those tests have already been migrated partly to junit but the rest of it is the problemive tried to migrate dbmsprocessortestjava but the code is no longer concise after thatfor example image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e e fce d fedf png this is the old version and image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e ae e e d eeb f d png that is the new version and that is only part of itthe reason is that i couldnt pass the parameters to the beforeeach method in junit but junit can use those local variable to pass the parameters i think this is where the difference occurred the gui test i just change the category annotation to tag annotation as i have known that those tests are mostly obsolete about cleanupworkertest this test is not hard to migrate from junit to but when i finish and run the tests on my ide two tests failed and the error message is quite weird it seems that the worker doesnt work in junit tests image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom be c a e e c a a d daeafepng and if there are any errors or something can be improved in other tests that i didnt

githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues thanks for your work most of the conversion looks good concerning your questions the exporter and importer tests use a filename based convention to find and check the tests for example https githubcom jabref jabref blob b f ff c af f d aabccf c src test java org jabref logic exporter modsexportformattestfilesjaval l finds all files that start with mods there are usually two files with the same name one with bib ending and one with xml the tests then should test that exporting the content of the bib file using the mods exporter give the contents of the xml file yes there is not yet a release of the new archunit so for now the architecture tests can stay using junit the mockito runner is not really needed its only purpose is to support the mock annotation but you can always use variable mock currently there is no neat way to handle this problem see the open https githubcom junit team junit issues looks good i think the problem is the setup in https githubcom jabref jabref pull filesdiff e fadfb af d d c f r the bib file should reside on the same level as the pdf folder and not within tobiasdiez thanks for your answer ill have a try soon tobiasdiez hi ive done some improments but i still have some questions i understand what you say but when i try to enable this line streamforeach n systemoutprintln n with no other code changed i still get nothing looks like therere no such files on my laptop i suspect that it is the cause of this problem done ill keep those tests for the time being as that kind of code is just frustrating and of course if you have any requirements ill use the complicated way to handle it done i have a try the cleanuprelativepathsconvertabsolutetorelativepath test passed but the cleanuprenamepdfrenamesrelativefile test still failed so i was wondering if you can give me a further guide about this it can be a big help image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f d aca efe e a b a af fpng btw the tests in fileutiltestjava use create method which is totally not recommended in the api guide so when migrating it to junit i name a folder manually to imitate the original tests and you can see this in the new version of fileutiltestjava if i do something wrong tell me and ill do my best to fix them soon the failing architecture test is one thing i already experienced a while ago its because it checks for public class i was so free to create a simple patch which fixes thissimply remove the txt extension after download and execute git am returns e \workspace\jabref\jabref\bin\main\org\jabref\logic\exporter although it should be bin test okay i found the issue with the paths i really wondered if it ever worked but well now it does the key is to point to one existing resource the rest can be found dynamically and this leads us actually to some failing tests but i would ignore that for the moment that is a difference metatronwings you can use this patch as a start for all the related importer exporter tests fix resolving of paths in msbibexporterpathpatchtxt https githubcom jabref jabref files fix resolving of paths in msbibexporterpathpatchtxt im very glad to see this issue will be resolved by us soon only a few more small questions some tests have not been migrated yet the dbmssynchronizertestjava and synchronizationtestsimulatorjava have not been migrated yet as there is no good way to handle chaos code after migration see example in dbmsprocessortestjava do i need to migrate themthe mainarchitecturetestswitharchunitjava have not too as there is not yet a release of the new archunit since i didnt migrate them how should i write the changelogmd and thanks for all of you 👍 metatronwings its okay we will sure find a way for them in the long run not that importantyou dont need to add a changelog entry as this is only a code quality issue which will not have any impact on the normal jabref user we hope you enjoyed it and if you want you can also further contribute looking to see more from you i just converted the two other classes with the legacy file methods to use

pending analyzing state is there something that i need to do from my side so that its analysis is completed hit it was probably stuck because you had a merge conflict in the changelogmd file i resolved this ps for future contributions create a new branch and do not work on master reduces potential conflicts thanks tobiasdiez thanks for reviewing for the preference value should only be treated as the default action when no modifier is pressed i dont think there is a straightforward solution using the dragevent https docsoraclecom javafx api javafx scene input drageventhtml used in the code this is because i wont be able to detect the modifiers pressed or confirm whether no modifier is pressed i will keep looking into this let me know if you have any guidance to resolve it the code you edited had this functionality before you can get the modifier using eventgettransfermode see also the code comments what will happen in a case where the transfermode is move and would have no shift key pressed at that time the comment states shift on win or no modifier how would i differentiate between transfermodemove without shift key pressed and dragdropped behavior from preference option as we want this to be read only when there no modifiers for the other two modes link and copy i was thinking to do an or with preference option but that would not be applicable for transfermodemove its probably not possible to differentiate between move no modifier and move shift thus i would suggest the following behavior move do what is configured in preferences default move rename and link file link link file except if preferences link in this case move rename and linkcopy do what is configured in preferences default move rename and link file in this way the user can configure the default action on windows and linux but is also possible to only link the file if he wants to just need some clarification on the behavior for link i got that if the transfer mode is link then we should allow the user to link file but if the preference is set to link with link as the transfer mode then why should we move rename and link file shouldnt we follow move rename and link when preference is set to move rename and link and not when it is set link i wasnt sure about this either my rationale was to allow for the following behavior users selects move & rename as default action no modifier move & rename ctrl transfermodelink link users selects link as default action no modifier link ctrl transfermodelink move & renamebecause otherwise the users has no option to perform move & rename if he selected link as the default action but im very open for suggestions if this behavior is counter intuitive i think your option is good but i just feel that it should be documented that what keys would be used for each option in preferences tab in brackets one more suggestion that we can consider is as follows pref move shift or no modifier move ctrl copy alt link pref copy shift or no modifier copy alt link alt is the default key for linking so user has one less thing to remember ctrl move pref link shift or no modifier link alt move ctrl copy ctrl is the default key for copying so user has one less thing to remember let me know your thoughts on this shahamish please be aware that the keys differ on other operating systems eg linux or mac and not all operating systems differ between all modifiers see my code comment regarding ubuntu somewhere https uxstackexchangecom questions what are the most common modifier keys for dragging objects with a mouse your suggestion looks good to mewhatever behavior we choose in the end it should be documented in the help and even better directly during the drag & drop action eg something like the following and replacing sposta with the real action to be performed but this is something for a new pr image https istackimgurcom a rtupng i have added the logic we discussed above and fixed the linkedfileseditor to allow moving of the files within the file editor i also updated the issue on helpjabref to follow the behavior as we have discussed here for documentation if tobiasdiez gives his

created for outdated help page at helpjabreforg https githubcom jabref helpjabreforg issues first of all thanks for your contribtion 👍 if you look at the code fo the old preferencesfilterdialog you see that the data comes from the jabrefpreferencesfilter class in orgjabrefpreferences if you have further questions you can also ask in out gitter chat https gitterim jabref jabrefedit adjusted my comment the easiest solution is probably to transverse the complete control node tree and take the text of all label controls wtfjoke paulkra what is the current status here the code looks already promising it would be really nice if you could finish this siedlerchr its still on my todo list havent found the time to investigate further and were stuck on how i display the filtered preferences i think paulkra doesnt work on it he still didnt accept my invitation link to my forked repo okay thanks for the udpate take your time if you have any questions just ask here or in gitter and we try to help maybe the jfxhighlighter from https githubcom jfoenixadmin jfoenix works to highlight the matches tobiasdiez thanks for the hint however i tested it locally but i didnt liked it that much for example it did mark the buttons for importing exporting show reset preferences also if i dont find alternatives i think about using it anways i tried the _jfoenix_ library but it didnt quite work as expected for eg labels remained highlighted even after changing the query text what i propose is to highlight the matched labels by styling their background with a different color we keep track of the highlighted labels and on every input change reset the highlighted labels and update it with new ones this could be optimized note the entire label is highlighted not a part of it captaindavinci sounds like a good plan the javafx pseudo class https thierrywasylwordpresscom style class vs pseudoclass in javafx seems to work nicely for this thanks for sharing the article tobiasdiez i added the search highlight feature in the latest commithowever i have made use of labeled objects hash code when inserting into the map this would result in a list of all labels instead of grouping them by their text could be replaced by a list instead to avoid this another approach would be to map the texts to a set of labels as well but considering that the number of labels wont be too large i dont think there will be any significant gain in performance the current approach looks good to me im however wondering why you have the map as the relation label or text tab for me the converse relation tab label feels more natural in the end it probably doesnt really mattersplease also use a mutlimap instead of map come to think of it the converse relation does seem more natural and has a simpler implementation ill make the required changes and push the codeedit i am thinking about how to perform better matching of labels for eg one of the tabs has a label named _sending of emails_ a query such as _sending emails_ would not match any labels but in practice i think it should one possible solution is to split the query string delimited by space and check if any token is present in the label name right now two filtering actions are performed by tabs and by labels i think both actions should be merged into one when no match is found the preference window shows contents of previous tab in this case i think the content of preference window should be replaced by the contents of the first tab which matches the query if none match then it should be blank captaindavinci is this ready for review or do you need to further work on it the first remark you had concerning sending emails is a nice suggestion for further improvement but not necessary for merging i would say tobiasdiez yes this is ready for review thank you for the suggestions tobiasdiez and siedlerchr i have refactored the code for the most part to account for the changes and will push the code once i have implemented all changes screenshot showing the preferences window when searching preferences https user imagesgithubusercontentcom b b db e f c d e bpng captaindavinci look at my patch import via git am { searchhandlersearchtextproperty required so that changed are reflected} hm this is odd it worked fine for me with this line searchhandlersearchtextproperty bindbidirectional searchboxtextproperty whenever i changed the text in the gui field eg key to asdfasd the view was updated and the new findings were highlighted maybe i understand you wrong but i think this is enough under the hood the bidirectional is nothing else than a wrapper around the changelistener stuff also note that its necessary to have a reference to searchtext property accessed under the changelistener for searchbox could this be related to some sort of premature garbage collectionedit for me changing the text in the gui field did not update the view or highlight the labels bindings are created using weaklistener so they might get garbage collected but i still dont understand why it works for me with the patch i would propose you test again with my patch or at least commit the changes and let others test as well unfortunately i am the next days busy at work and probably cant help much okay i have pushed changes in the mean time i will try testing it again ps since the preferencessearchhandler does not

good to me i believe that removing the three tools opening a folder file or url doi apply disables the associated shortcuts eg f to open a file can you please make sure the shortcuts work as expected and if not add some code for this here https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref gui jabrefframejaval ive a few questions for martinkarim why he proposed certain changes some of which are not too intuitive for me replace string from edit to tools & set clear rename append fields from edit to library both of these operations change field values of the currently selected entries or all entries and thus for me have the same quality as the manage keywords feature which is essentially a special version of set fields moreover all these three features dont involve any magic on jabrefs part in contrast to tools but they are different versions of bulk edits but thats definitely a developer viewpoint and not a user centric one im fine with moving all three to tools although i feel this menu gets overloaded a bitmoreover i would suggest t rename replace string by find and replace find unlinked files from quality to tools for me this feature is connected to the set file link feature because once you linked a file to an entry that it is no longer reported under unlinked files and vice versa the find unliked files dialog allows to link files to entries so personally i would group them together new sublibrary based on aux file from tools to library with the reasoning that adding a sublibrary has a global effect on the library however this feature does not add entries to the current library but uses the aux file to select certain entries and then creates a new library containing only these entries so in some sense it is a certain kind of export thus for me it should go to the export menu under file or stay in tools yes you are right now those shortcuts are disabled although ctrl a for selecting all is still workingin addition i just realized that sometimes the check symbol of the checkitem objects tools web search groups interface is not synchronized with it side paneli will deal with it in a while the check synchronization might be a problem with setting the values correctly in the preferences i remember having similar issues with shown not shown in the openoffice panel i had to explicitly set the preferences to new values i hope the check synchronization is solved now also i have recovered the previous entry preview elements and behaviorplease tell me if it is ok thank you you seem to have a compile error now probably because of the parameter removal in the check menu stuffyou can click on the travis failed icon and will see the jobs that failed you then can expand them and will see the errors yes my fault i am so busy these days and cannot focus on it properly i will solve this asapsorry for wasting your time no problem take your time siedlerchr what about the coverage test do i need to get an equal or greather percent you can ignore the code coverage and the dependency update testcodacy is sometimes a bit difficult as for some fxml stuff it is generating false positives eg marking functions as unused but does not take into account that these are defined in fxml we are generally not so focused on code coverage but prefer tests for the most important model logic functionality by the way i have forgotten to say that this code keeps the associated shortcuts because those choices are also in the right click menu tobiasdiez i am sorry for being late in answering your questions here are my thoughts on why i moved the items features you mentioned _replace string_ i do think that the the main difference between this feature and _manage keywords_ is the possibility to change a string in all entries and not just selected ones meaning the scope of the function separates it from the other items in _edit_additionally replacing a string is not bound to a field like _mangage keywords_ or _rank entry_ therefore it has a more general purpose i would arguehowever i agree that it does not completely fit into the _tools_ tab as well moving it there was a try to give the function more exposure because many users did not know about the _tools_ tab is a central part of the users workflow which is why i chose that tabthe name change for the feature is great i think because it matches the name of the same feature in other programs _set clear rename append fields_ i proposed to move this feature to library because i thought that the four functions it contains had a global effect on all entries i have noticed that this was a misunderstanding on my part so i will have another look at the featurebut i still think that the feature as a whole does not fit the _edit_ tab because of the rename part renaming is not really a content change and it has more complex implications for an entry if the renaming function was split from the rest keeping it in _edit_ seems appropriate _find unlinked files_ while _set file links_ does only improve the quality of existing entries by associating a file this feature is a bit more versatile it can also help to find files in a folder which do not even have a bibliography entry yet and can even be used to extract bibliographic information from a pdf i think that the ways of using this feature go beyond qa measures which is why i proposed to move it _new sublibrary based on aux file_ i think that you are right in regard to this function being an export function and that it could be moved to _export_ as well then it would have to be renamed though into something like export entries cited in aux file however export has the connotation of some change in the data format which is not really the case with this feature because it only creates a subset of the current bibliography i found the _library_ tab appropriate because the feature is bound to the active library and therefore depends on it and an aux file i think all four points are up to discussion and depend on the view of the individual this is why i think that especially the grouping of items in the main menu would profit from more user data to have a more objective center in that discussion thanks martinkarim for your detailed explanation that clarifies a lot for me and im fine with these changes for the sake of moving forward with this pr i would propose to rename replace string to find and replace move new sublibrary based on aux file to toolsas part of this pr and then merge davidemdot could you please implement these changes thanksthen as a second step we should discuss in the devcall set clear rename append fields edit library or tools new sublibrary based on aux file library tools export how to improve telemetry collection tobiasdiez i think it is done now

check synchronization is solved now also i have recovered the previous entry preview elements and behaviorplease tell me if it is ok thank you you seem to have a compile error now probably because of the parameter removal in the check menu stuffyou can click on the travis failed icon and will see the jobs that failed you then can expand them and will see the errors yes my fault i am so busy these days and cannot focus on it properly i will solve this asapsorry for wasting your time no problem take your time siedlerchr what about the coverage test do i need to get an equal or greather percent you can ignore the code coverage and the dependency update testcodacy is sometimes a bit difficult as for some fxml stuff it is generating false positives eg marking functions as unused but does not take into account that these are defined in fxml we are generally not so focused on code coverage but prefer tests for the most important model logic functionality by the way i have forgotten to say that this code keeps the associated shortcuts because those choices are also in the right click menu tobiasdiez i am sorry for being late in answering your questions here are my thoughts on why i moved the items features you mentioned _replace string_ i do think that the the main difference between this feature and _manage keywords_ is the possibility to change a string in all entries and not just selected ones meaning the scope of the function separates it from the other items in _edit_additionally replacing a string is not bound to a field like _mangage keywords_ or _rank entry_ therefore it has a more general purpose i would arguehowever i agree that it does not completely fit into the _tools_ tab as well moving it there was a try to give the function more exposure because many users did not know about the _tools_ tab is a central part of the users workflow which is why i chose that tabthe name change for the feature is great i think because it matches the name of the same feature in other programs _set clear rename append fields_ i proposed to move this feature to library because i thought that the four functions it contains had a global effect on all entries i have noticed that this was a misunderstanding on my part so i will have another look at the featurebut i still think that the feature as a whole does not fit the _edit_ tab because of the rename part renaming is not really a content change and it has more complex implications for an entry if the renaming function was split from the rest keeping it in _edit_ seems appropriate _find unlinked files_ while _set file links_ does only improve the quality of existing entries by associating a file this feature is a bit more versatile it can also help to find files in a folder which do not even have a bibliography entry yet and can even be used to extract bibliographic information from a pdf i think that the ways of using this feature go beyond qa measures which is why i proposed to move it _new sublibrary based on aux file_ i think that you are right in regard to this function being an export function and that it could be moved to _export_ as well then it would have to be renamed though into something like export entries cited in aux file however export has the connotation of some change in the data format which is not really the case with this feature because it only creates a subset of the current bibliography i found the _library_ tab appropriate because the feature is bound to the active library and therefore depends on it and an aux file i think all four points are up to discussion and depend on the view of the individual this is why i think that especially the grouping of items in the main menu would profit from more user data to have a more objective center in that discussion thanks martinkarim for your detailed explanation that clarifies a lot for me and im fine with these changes for the sake of moving forward with this pr i would propose to rename replace string to find and replace move new sublibrary based on aux file to toolsas part of this pr and then merge davidemdot could you please implement these changes thanksthen as a second step we should discuss in the devcall set clear rename append fields edit library or tools new sublibrary based on aux file library tools export how to improve telemetry collection tobiasdiez i think it is done now

and if not add some code for this here https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref gui jabrefframejaval ive a few questions for martinkarim why he proposed certain changes some of which are not too intuitive for me replace string from edit to tools & set clear rename append fields from edit to library both of these operations change field values of the currently selected entries or all entries and thus for me have the same quality as the manage keywords feature which is essentially a special version of set fields moreover all these three features dont involve any magic on jabrefs part in contrast to tools but they are different versions of bulk edits but thats definitely a developer viewpoint and not a user centric one im fine with moving all three to tools although i feel this menu gets overloaded a bitmoreover i would suggest t rename replace string by find and replace find unlinked files from quality to tools for me this feature is connected to the set file link feature because once you linked a file to an entry that it is no longer reported under unlinked files and vice versa the find unliked files dialog allows to link files to entries so personally i would group them together new sublibrary based on aux file from tools to library with the reasoning that adding a sublibrary has a global effect on the library however this feature does not add entries to the current library but uses the aux file to select certain entries and then creates a new library containing only these entries so in some sense it is a certain kind of export thus for me it should go to the export menu under file or stay in tools yes you are right now those shortcuts are disabled although ctrl a for selecting all is still workingin addition i just realized that

entries or all entries and thus for me have the same quality as the manage keywords feature which is essentially a special version of set fields moreover all these three features dont involve any magic on jabrefs part in contrast to tools but they are different versions of bulk edits but thats definitely a developer viewpoint and not a user centric one im fine with moving all three to tools although i feel this menu gets overloaded a bitmoreover i would suggest t rename replace string by find and replace find unlinked files from quality to tools for me this feature is connected to the set file link feature because once you linked a file to an entry that it is no longer reported under unlinked files and vice versa the find unliked files dialog allows to link files to entries so personally i would group them together new sublibrary based on aux file from tools to library with the reasoning that adding a sublibrary has a global effect on the library however this feature does not add entries to the current library but uses the aux file to select certain entries and then creates a new library containing only these entries so in some sense it is a certain kind of export thus for me it should go to the export menu under file or stay in tools yes you are right now those shortcuts are disabled although ctrl a for selecting all is still workingin addition i just realized that sometimes the check symbol of the checkitem objects tools web search groups interface is not synchronized with it side paneli will deal with it in a while the check synchronization might be a problem with setting the values correctly in the preferences i remember having similar issues with shown not shown in the openoffice panel i had to explicitly set the preferences to new values i hope the check synchronization is solved now also i have recovered the previous entry preview elements and behaviorplease tell me if it is ok thank you you seem to have a compile error now probably because of the parameter removal in the check menu stuffyou can click on the travis failed icon and will see the jobs that failed you then can expand them and will see the errors yes my fault i am so busy these days and cannot focus on it properly i will solve this asapsorry for wasting your time no problem take your time siedlerchr what about the coverage test do i need to get an equal or greather percent you can ignore the code coverage and the dependency update testcodacy is sometimes a bit difficult as for some fxml stuff it is generating false positives eg marking functions as unused but does not take into account that these are defined in fxml we are generally not so focused on code coverage but prefer tests for the most important model logic functionality by the way i have forgotten to say that this code keeps the associated shortcuts because those choices are also in the right click menu tobiasdiez i am sorry for being late in answering your questions here are my thoughts on why i moved the items features you mentioned _replace string_ i do think that the the main difference between this feature and _manage keywords_ is the possibility to change a string in all entries and not just selected ones meaning the scope of the function separates it from the other items in _edit_additionally replacing a string is not bound to a field like _mangage keywords_ or _rank entry_ therefore it has a more general purpose i would arguehowever i agree that it does not completely fit into the _tools_ tab as well moving it there was a try to give the function more exposure because many users did not know about the _tools_ tab is a central part of the users workflow which is why i chose that tabthe name change for the feature is great i think because it matches the name of the same feature in other programs _set clear rename append fields_ i proposed to move this feature to library because i thought that the four functions it contains had a global effect on all entries i have noticed that this was a misunderstanding on my part so i will have another look at the featurebut i still think that the feature as a whole does not fit the _edit_ tab because of the rename part renaming is not really a content change and it has more complex implications for an entry if the renaming function was split from the rest keeping it in _edit_ seems appropriate _find unlinked files_ while _set file links_ does only improve the quality of existing entries by associating a file this feature is a bit more versatile it can also help to find files in a folder which do not even have a bibliography entry yet and can even be used to extract bibliographic information from a pdf i think that the ways of using this feature go beyond qa measures which is why i proposed to move it _new sublibrary based on aux file_ i think that you are right in regard to this function being an export function and that it could be moved to _export_ as well then it would have to be renamed though into something like export entries cited in aux file however export has the connotation of some change in the data format which is not really the case with this feature because it only creates a subset of the current bibliography i found the _library_ tab appropriate because the feature is bound to the active library and therefore depends on it and an aux file i think all four points are up to discussion and depend on the view of the individual this is why i think that especially the grouping of items in the main menu would profit from more user data to have a more objective center in that discussion thanks martinkarim for your detailed explanation that clarifies a lot for me and im fine with these changes for the sake of moving forward with this pr i would propose to rename replace string to find and replace move new sublibrary based on aux file to toolsas part of this pr and then merge davidemdot could you please implement these changes thanksthen as a second step we should discuss in the devcall set clear rename append fields edit library or tools new sublibrary based on aux file library tools export how to improve telemetry collection tobiasdiez i think it is done now

about the points you mentioned the documentation you read is not up to date especially in terms of the dialogue popups on branch milestone we already reused the existing pop up window and added the entries automatically after parsing moreover since the user might want to add multiple entries at once we inserted a checkbox which enables the user to create a new library tab so that possibly wrong parsed references are not immediately in his the current libraryscreenshot ceckbox https user imagesgithubusercontentcom be af f ea c ed ac cbpng we will change the buttons soon we changed our mind and do not intend to implement the conversion function tei to bib by ourselves anymore after seeing this https githubcom kermitt grobid blob master grobid core src main java org grobid core data biblioitemjaval method and this https githubcom kermitt grobid blob master grobid core src main java org grobid core data biblioitemjaval method the reference text is parsed by the grobid server which already has the needed function we just change the function to return the processed citation in bibtex format rather than tei format here https githubcom kermitt grobid blob master grobid service src main java org grobid service process grobidrestprocessstringjaval thats why we need a custom grobid server we will link this server in this pr we already implemented a checkbox to use a custom grobid server ip preferences advanced tab if unchecked the default value is selected probably we should set that to http cloudscience minercom grobid but the problem is that this server seems to be constantly overwhelmed by the number of incoming requests thats why we hosted the server on localhost for testing purposes you can find a manual how to start that server here https grobidreadthedocsio en latest grobid service it uses gradle screenshot grobid https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d f ea b ccpng we will try to change our package structure button placing as well as used dependencies according to your suggestions this week we will also try to update the documentation concerning maybe switch the two buttons in the existing implementation the go on button should always be right and never label cancel label it return to library so that the user knows what happens that depends on the os you can add the correct type https docsoraclecom javase javafx api javafx scene control buttontypehtml and then javafx will put them in the right order automatically and cancel is pretty ok please merge https githubcom jabref jabref pull into your branch then i will close that pr 👍 i would make the checkbox an additional buttoninsert into current library and insert into new library here is the link to the custom grobid server https githubcom nikodemkch grobid koppor do we have the resources to host the grobid server i dont think many people have the knowledge to install and setup gropid on localhost tobiasdiez there are options maybe we just limit the request rates just limit the requests per user per hour or simply charge for it we will check options how to host and maybe host some public service in beta we finished our work for this week except unit test and

important that the server is maintained by the jabref developers team ive already set up the default grobid server but what i read is that you want to customize the server can you point me to a repo

whats the current status here is this already ready for review or do you need input on certain parts today we will fix the requested changes and try to fix the travis pipeline then we will open the pr for review sadly we will probably not find the time to change the grobid server as requested as the examination phase is kicking in first exam on december th this pr is now ready for review sadly the

portability in platform as a service} } result is so so however user experience is ok the only thing is the textbox can it be soft wrappedwe made the conscious design choice to go without softwrapping user input to improve quality of user experience when passing multiple entries but changing it isnt a problem and we should be able implement softwrapping together with the other requested changes until the weekend i see the problem we decided to split entries at line breaks regex \\\r\\\n without the line break you copied over from the website the result is quite better article{kolbjune july author {s kolb and j lenhard and g wirtz} year {june july } address {new york ny usa} booktitle {application migration effort in the cloud the case of cloud platforms proceedings of the th ieee international conference on cloud computing cloud }} softwrap makes sense since it mentally prevents the user from adding more breaks after he pasted his referenceswe thought using line breaks would be most convenient but we can easily change this to double line breaks or even something else so what do you think koppor as the example shows it would be indeed good to change the item separation to two lines so that one empty line needs to be between the entries could you also add this as a short comment in the prompt text please enter the plain text references to make it easier for users to discover the feature thanks ready for review againsee comments in open issues abovealso the feature now separates at double empty lines onlyand this is displayed to the user since the commit below think we are good to gofor a follow up the accept header should be set i created a follow up issue at https githubcom koppor jabref issues thank you so much for working on this issue and keeping up the work after the exam phase 🎉 koppor the address is still pointing to tum and your alias is not working https githubcom jabref jabref pull filesr would be nice to fix this before the release we also want to thank you very much it was a great experience for the whole team to participate on your project it was very helpful that you mentioned so many import details that we didnt see that helped us improving our skills to become a good software engineer 🎉 tobiasdiez added it to https githubcom koppor jabref issues koppor good but can we also fix that before we release this weekend thank you for your support and feedback during the development of this featurei got response for my feature request at grobid asking for a service call that can process multiple requests at once https githubcom kermitt grobid issues issuecomment indeed the second use case is not what we are looking foras i understand i as caller would have the choice between sending everything in one request with little slower processing or creating and collecting multiple async threads but slightly faster processing so what do you think koppor tobiasdiez

panel for openoffice libreoffice as well this is the same one as in the entry editor so it should be easy to adaptthanks so much for the feedback everyonestarted working on a few of the changes as for the changes to the openoffice style selection theres a method in gui preview previewviewerjava called settheme that can apply a theme to previewarticle and previewbook in gui openoffice styleselectdialogviewjava with a note about an open issue on openjdk https githubcom openjdk jfx pull i was able to add previewarticlesettheme dark_css to get the text in the openoffice style selection to fit the dark mode but because it only takes strings i havent been able to get a string value for the current theme applied so that the style selections appearance matches the theme selectedheres the methods code public void settheme string theme { if themeequals themeloaderdark_css { we need to load the css file manually due to a bug in the jdk todo remove this workaround as soon as https githubcom openjdk jfx pull is merged url url jabrefframeclassgetresource themeloaderdark_css string dataurl data text csscharsetutf base base getencoder encodetostring stringutilgetresourcefileasstring url getbytes previewviewgetengine setuserstylesheetlocation dataurl } } what do you mean with the following but because it only takes strings i havent been able to get a string value for the current theme applied so that the style selections appearance matches the theme selectedthe method allows you to load the darkcss in which you then can add change the necessary style information what do you mean with the following but because it only takes strings i havent been able to get a string value for the current theme applied so that the style selections appearance matches the theme selected the method allows you to load the darkcss in which you then can add change the necessary style informationbecause it checks if darkcss is passed in as an argument and switches to dark theme if it is it needs a string that says which theme is active for it to change according to what theme the user selectedat the time i couldnt find one but i found the hashmap in jabrrefpreferences and passed that into it now with jabrefpreferences prefs jabrefpreferencesgetinstance and previewarticlesettheme prefsget jabrefpreferencesfx_theme which appear to worktesting right now will update my pull requests later today with that addition and your earlier suggestions jabrefpreferences prefs jabrefpreferencesgetinstance and previewarticlesettheme prefsget jabrefpreferencesfx_theme which appear to workin the style select dialogview you have access to the preferences via the preferences service which is a wrapper for dependency injection via the fxml loader for the jabrefpreferenceswe try to pass dependencies always as constructor arguments inversion of control principle to avoid direct dependency callsso the idea would be to add a method eg getactivetheme to the preferencesservice which returns the theme for the preferences then you can call settheme on the previewviewer hey many thanks once again for everyones feedbackthe newest commit

required and optional fields i would add one big list of all fields with a checkbox toggling between required optional thanks for the idea that indeed sounds more practical maybe a radio button column question which just came to my mind do we allow changing the default entry types and their fields eg removing a field from an entry type like article koppor yes it was possible to add remove fields from the built in entry types tobiasdiez what is the preferred way to add new fields to a an existing entry typei saw the entrytypesmanager with the addcustomormodifiedtype but i am not sure if this is the right approach yes that methods sounds right i vaguely remember that the complete entry type had to be replaced instead of only specifying the added removed fields easiest way is probably to look at the original code this looks really nice and is leagues above the original dialog in terms of user friendliness good job still a few things to do especially saving and removing all the fields back to the db and the prefs but at least adding to the gui already works without any further effects tobiasdiez do you have an idea why the tableview content has these empty fields when i change between a list with more and fewer fields tableview is bound bidirecitonal to the fieldsfortypeproperty thisfieldsfortypeproperty new simplelistproperty existingfieldsfortype easybindsubscribe

and not yet ready especially saving is not yet implemented in biblatex mode there should be position required optional optional burrbull we want to drop the difference between optional and optional field sin the long run we had already discussion about this in the past hi a very useful functionality in was the manual sorting not only in alphabetical order of the fields in the edit entry panel

or at least two types with the same name exceptions occur when deleting them adding several or sometimes just one new fields without any name exception thats one thing i want to prevent empty fields and empty entry types wont be allowed will add a validator that in the next daysjust wanted to be curious about the table updating refreshing the main difference between the other table for external

refreshing the main difference between the other table for external file types and this one is that i created a viewmodel for the table and i think in the other dialog the externalfiletype is directly

if applicable tests created for changes if applicable manually tested changed features in running jabref always required screenshots added in pr description for bigger ui changes checked documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not issue created at thanks for your pr as this is a display issue i would prefer if this could be fixed on the gui side ie no changes in the logic package one option would be to use the built in javafx facilities and put the text in a labeled control and use the textoverrun https docsoraclecom javase javafx api javafx scene control labeledhtmltextoverrunproperty the first argument in the constructor of the java fx menuitem requires a string https githubcom jabref jabref blob efe b e ec b e d d cac e c src main java org jabref gui maintable maintablecolumnfactoryjaval so unfortunately my hands are tied here you can set the text overrun property also on the menu item https docsoraclecom javase javafx api javafx scene control labeledhtmltextoverrunproperty i could not find out a way how to adapt it using the menuitem both links redirect to the same web page suggestions are welcome the labeled is part of the menuitem and thus cannot be accessed directly from code however its possible to use css similar to here https stackoverflowcom questions how to set context menu width to match choice box not all works as preferred but at least it is better than without it fx pref width makes the item bigger as needed but at least it works fx max width and fx text overrun center ellipses would be preferred but it does not work fx wrap text true does not work either its slightly frustrating since it should have been a quick fix feel free to suggest any solution for me adding menu item label { fx pref width px} in basecss worked this of course has to be further specialized as this changes every menu item image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ca b d ea ea dc e bbpng fx pref width already works the way it is implemented so far in my opinion px is too small because hardly anything can be read in the combination with description and url this gets even worse furthermore this overrunstylecenter_ellipsis thingy or any other customized overrunstyle does not work as expected i personally prefer my initial commit where both the description and the url get centered ellipsis since this shows the relevant parts in a perfect way and the context menus width is only as big as needed but limited as well thus this is what i currently use for my local jabref version^^ how about moving the truncation code from the first commit to the location where there is now this fx pref width i agree px is too small i just wanted to show you how pref width ellipses do work truncating the link and the description separately is indeed a good suggestion should be able by putting them in separate labels with pref width elipse overflow systemoperator ping 😇 the current implementation has the following flaws opening the context menu where several files links are associated even if the texts are very short the width of the context menu has the defined max width fx max width does not work at all so fx pref width has been used but it always sets the context menu to the defined max width and wrapping the text does not work either preference the context menu should only be as big as needed otherwise its irritating and disturbing i have tried to fix it but i did not succeed it seems to be a bug if the text in the context menu exceeds the defined max width then it currently gets truncated at the end of the text with right ellipses even though i have declared that centered ellipses fx text overrun center ellipses should be used probably this is another bug preference centered ellipses should be shown descriptive text of the file dfdfdf asdas filehtml if this works another improvement would be using centered ellipses for both the descriptive text and for the path link descriptive file https wwwyzd filehtml my initial commit truncated the text itself and added centered ellipses which would eliminate the aforementioned second flaw furthermore there was no need to define a max width since the text was truncated and thus also the context menu itself did not exceed a specific width and was only as wide as required by the text as a result it would have eliminated all flaws mentioned aboveconsidering all the issues concerning the java fx components i would tend to a solution which simply truncates the texts itself as already suggested in earlier comments above this is what i currently use for my local jabref instance okay youve convinced me its a bit unfortunate that there is no css based fix because i really think that truncating should be handled by the javafx controls but well if its not possible then yeahso im fine with changing the display text itself as it was done in one of your earliest commits please add a helper method to controlhelper https githubcom jabref jabref blob master src main java org jabref gui util controlhelperjava that does the actually truncation and can be reused a bit similar to https githubcom openjdk jfx blob b af e d b a ef ff cd modules javafxcontrols src main java com sun javafx scene control skin utilsjaval which might also be helpful for the implementation thanks tobiasdiez what do you think about it merging now thank you

not a gui expert and am wondering whether my fix is appropriate and is considered clean in the mvc concept since the functionality was already implemented in the linkedfileviewmodel i just created an instance and let it handle the download is that ok if not copying the code over and resolving some dependencies would be the easiest but also the dirtiest solution to this problem is there an appropriate place the code in linkedfileviewmodel could be moved so it is callable in importentriesviewmodelfixes image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d b ea d e d dd png change in changelogmd

documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not created an issue at or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository thanks for your contribution looks good already i think your approach is the best solution there are multiple pieces in the code which create the linkedfileviewmodel so its totally fineif you want to learn more about the gui principle mvvm https devdocsjabreforg readings on coding javafxif you want to make it persistent i think an option in the preferences is fine maybe add to the file tab then you could add it as part of the filepreferences please do not add the translations here directly they are managed via https crowdincom project jabref and will be overwritten if you modify them here hi thanks for the fast reply so i should add the english file and leave the others be thanks for your contribution looks good already i think your approach is the best solution there are multiple pieces in the code which create the linkedfileviewmodel so its totally fine if you want to learn more about the gui principle mvvm https devdocsjabreforg readings on coding javafx if you want to make it persistent i think an option in the preferences is fine maybe add to the file tab then you could add it as part of the filepreferencesi think the import tab would be more appropriate dont you think just add it where it suits best i went with filepreferences after all as the other settings of the importtab are stored there as wellone last thing that bugs me after downloading the file it is put after the online link so when i click on the entry it still opens the online link i think it would make sense to reverse that order dont you thinki plan on reversing it in any case and giving the user the option in the preferences only not on each import to remove the online link in case a file was successfully downloaded btut yes that sounds like a good idea but i am not sure if removing the online link at all is a good idea there might be cases where its useful to keep it maybe when you share the bib file and the other user does not have downloaded the pdf yet just put the pdf in front of the link siedlerchr exactly thats why i would have that functionality configurable in preferences and off by default okay that sounds reasonable i noticed that jabref was opening the online link by default not because the file was second in the list but because it was never actually linked to the entry i did that and now when clicking on the file jabref asks me if i want to open the link or the filenow it makes no more sense to me to have the option to delete the link and i will not implement it ok i think i am satisfied nowto sum up the import dialog now offers a check box if the user selects the check box and the imported entry contains an online link jabref will download the file it is stored in the directory set up by file directory pattern and named according to the filename format pattern in the import tab of the preferences dialog the file entry is prepended to the imported bib entrythe user can choose to have that check box selected by default in the import tab of the preferences dialog thanks codewise looks good to megreat also good that you now take the filedirpattern and filenamepattern into account i think this was also one issue when downloading from the entry editorindeed this bugged me even before i coded this feature i tried looking for an issue to reference here but could not find any thoug so maybe this was just me btut thanks again for your good work looking forward seeing more from you i think the status item is enough work for another pr best thing would probably to finish the logic of this pr first with the most basic progress indicator possible merge this pr and then create another pr for the status indicator as it would probably affect way more parts of the code dont misunderstand me i do like the idea of a generic progress for jabref toojust do one step after another ok to conclude this pr i suggest the following pr to fix the entry duplication for the right click download action pr to remove the dead progress bar code pr to implement the list of background tasks and its graphical representation in the guii can probably get to the first two today but will need some time for the third i will create a pr after only a couple of commits so we can start discussing there i hope you dont mind great thank you go aheadsplitting this up in multiple prs makes it just easier to review and later to debug if there are unknown sideeffects

trigger on mac and this resulted in executing paste twicefixes i really dont get where the bug is reverting this reopens issue especially because by logic this should be here so where is the bug this should be fixed before calixtus whoops i overlooked the original issue for your pr so we are in some kind of situation where we have contradicting behavior in two operating systems that kinda sucks since we need to differentiate between those now last time this was the fix https githubcom jabref jabref pull but maybe this is when we also introduced i have been thinking this through since the hint of siedlerchr the thing is the insert command should stand here is there another issue with macos some method fired by macos we did not see yet if we dont find out the root cause in mac we could add an ugly os check for linux mac i already stumbled upon other methods jabrefframein openaction quit and about especially for macos did i mention that i dont like apple 😉 i agree with calixtus the command there makes sense linusdietz can you debug and report which other code triggers the paste command on macos os macos catalina e hello everyoneim currently trying to reproduce the error of non working menu items or duplicating objects during paste command from google scholar and between two bib libraries but i canti use intellij idea to start jabrefare there any issues with copy paste gena just to double check you are on latest master https githubcom jabref jabref linusdietz maybe you can add a screencast using loom https wwwloomcom koppor yes im on latest masteri downloaded last build and pulled changes from github both last build and source code in intellij show no error ie record inserts without duplicates looks like i see an errorits very phantom ie i still can not understand what should i do to repeat it sometimes i have entries inserted sometimes only one ill continue testing and try to do something about it ok i need some help looks like paste command of maintablejava executed twice in editactionjava and this was deleted by current pull request now its back again line framegetcurrentbasepanel paste in maintablejava method setupkeybindings i tracked first case and it turns out that editactionexecute called by jabrefframejava line createmenu method when i commented that line jabref inserts only one item per each ctrl v commandso in general paste command is called first time because we have maintablesetupkeybindings and it triggered by ctrl v second time because ctrl v command triggers main menu command edit paste sorry for our late replythank you for you work in tracing this bugthe deletion of framegetcurrentbasepanel paste was the unsuccessful attempt to fix the issue in this prwould you like to create a fix for this issue following your investigations and to open a new pr so we can probably close this one and merge yours with the master branch calixtus i hoped to get some ideas about solving this issue ok if there are no any ideas i will continue to investigate myself we have to disable main menu from listening ctrl v and keep it listening in maintablejava ill be back with ideas does ctrl c or ctrl x also call an edit action maybe there is some design flaw in a hotkey that is defined twice by setupkeybindings and the the menu command ctrl x works in the same way when i press command x the program deletes two entries from current lib then i move the cursor to another lib and press command v jabref inserts last entry to the new library ie one entry just disappearsit looks like jabref cut entries twicechecked from intellij and using last stable version from jabreforg why do we need setupkeybindings method in maintablejava when i delete copy paste cut commands from it the program works finethis lines case paste paste eventconsume break case copy copy eventconsume break case cut cut eventconsume so why do we need those commands in maintablejava the reason is that you can define custom keybindings options manage keybindings for all commands and so people can use their emacs vim whatever paste command stylefor mac we use the keybindings and simply replace ctrl with meta in the keybindingrepositorymaybe that is part of the problem as well public keycombination getkeycombination keybinding bindname { string binding get bindnamegetconstant if osos_x { binding bindingreplace ctrl meta } return keycombinationvalueof binding } siedlerchr if i remove this line of code binding bindingreplace ctrl meta i just have to use command button on mac instead of control a bit more natural for iosthe problem persistswhat about main menu i mean if you wanna change key combinations and we remove that lines from maintablejava does main menu works with new key combinations for copy pase cut i will test this on windows options customize keybindings grafik https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f a ea e c dc d f a png i changed copy paste to the following alt gr o and alt gr p i can copy and paste using those shortcuts ctrl c and ctrl v then dont worki also tested uncommenting the setupkeybindings in maintableno difference no duplicatesso now we would need someone on linux who can test this linux user wanted lyzardking could you assist in testing this on linux assigg some other shortcuts to copy pastetest if it worksand then do a test with commenting out the method setupkeybindings in maintable sure i can test both stable and the version from buildsjabreforgits not clear to me what i should be doingive never had duplicates in pasting if thats the issue here issue was about merging in pasting in linux and windows lets follow the mac related stuff here will look into this as i have now a mac at hand nope didnt fix it but i think i found the real reason now doesnt work on linuxi hadnt noticed this issue before in the deb it now doesnt work even if i press ctrl v i think i have found the root cause now pasting to a new library should work now as well please try again when the new build is ready new build is ready please try pasting an entry from a library to a new empty libraryhttps buildsjabreforg pull merge it works but i have top copy ctrl v multiple times to get it to work if the library is emptythe copy paste buttons are not active on an empty libraryon a not empty library it works normally works fine on windows as well the menu buttons are disabled on windows as well i think they are only activated if you have at least one entry selected but this is a minor issuetherefore i would propose to merge this regarding the disabled enabled menu items we track the issues at https githubcom koppor jabref issues the problem turns out to be a bit complex we need to find a way to differ if an action was triggered by key or not or to move the keybinding from the maintable to the edit actiontherefore i would prefer to have this pr in as it enables copy pasting vai keyboard commands and we can reopen the other issue regarding the menu commands

bibtex key curly brackets are not respected in the maintables author column fix to the prepended null what is going on bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets eg {the school of life} the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key eg null if there is no name why is it going on academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg royal institute of technology the school of electrical engineering and computer science which generateinstitutionkey shortens to riteecs fix replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys eg the school of life l what are alternatives regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of the school of life would be abbreviated to sl instead of l fix to the author column when the list of authors gets converted to a latex free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex free string is used to create fetch an authorlist it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone what i think is left to do x find out why {the school of life} isnt respected in the author field of the gui x attempt to match universities etc with regex assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities x update bibtexkeygeneratortest as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file x see if the readability of generateinstitutionkey can be improved x

isnt respected in the author field of the guii think it could be that the latex unicode convert is called for the author field it kills the extra braces i had a similar problem in the msoffice

bibtex version are supported but the problems are i cant find which bibtex version we are supporting in adr https githubcom jabref jabref tree master docs adr nor anywhere else bibentrygetlatexfreefield appears to be used both for bibtex in utf eg {lâtëx} and for fully expanded text eg lâtëx as those are incompatible perhaps it makes sense to split the method and track down what method wants what should i do this i can attempt to do the same workaround but it doesnt really solve the problem as i understand it i can also look at it a bit more and see if i have missed something anyway any suggestion hint is greatly appreciated siedlerchr hithanks for investigating the underlying problem is the latex unicode external library kills the braces it has of course no understanding of an author refs and i fear there is no easy solution we use the latexfree field method to not have latex code displayed in the main table i would treat this as a secondary issueregarding the second issue replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys eg the school of life l what about using a formatter that uses the capital letters eg jabref would then become jrand orgs with abbreviations eg uno or who would stay as is similar to the title formatter regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantif i understand things correctly there are currently three different cases relevant to and assuming we are using the bibtex format described at bibtexorg special symbols http wwwbibtexorg specialsymbols plain bibtex eg kurt {g\od}el used as the internal representation bibtex with unicode eg kurt {göd}el used for exporting to a unicode aware file format and editing in unicode formatted text eg k gödel used to display to a user or export to a latex bibtex unaware environment bibentrygetlatexfreefield handles case while to the best of my knowledge no function method handles case the issue with case is that latex and bibtex are two incompatible languages since some reserved words are the same therefore if we are using the format described at bibtexorg format http wwwbibtexorg format the correct way of dealing with case using bibentrygetlatexfreefield is to either split out the latex components and translate them to unicode separately or to escape the parts that are in bibtex format if i am using the bibtexorg format http wwwbibtexorg format at least all non nested curly bracketsl not preceded by a keyword should be escaped {jabref} \{jabref\} proceedings of the {ieee} proceedings of the \{ieee\} which is then dealt with correctly in bibentrygetlatexfreefield what i was trying to argue is that case and case must be dealt with differently i can deal with this after issue if that is of interest however i just realized that issue is case and can most likely be solved by changing the order of method calls please point out if something is unclear or incomprehensible i am trying to improve my writing skills but i am well aware that i have some practice ahead of me my only excuse is that it is still morning here x regarding the second issue that does sound better i cant think of any case where keeping all capitalized letters isnt good and it should be compatible with the current implementation regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantno problem we are happy for every contributor its just a complex issue its just complicated issue because it involves corporate authors and unicodei try to provide some background on this unicode originally bibtex and latex did not support unicode thats why you have to use those latex escaping of umlauts and other charactersbiblatex the successor of bibtex supports unicode but many journals still require bibtexand many citations from online resources still contain latex escaping of charactersoriginally jabref maintained a bidirectional mapping between latex escaped characters and their unicode equivalent some time ago we switched to the latex unicode library https githubcom tomtung latex unicode of course javafx has no idea of latex therefore having a title or an author encoded in latex must obviously converted to unicode for displayeg kurt {g\od}el becomes kurt gödel corporate authors see the biblatex manual https mirrorinformatikhs fuldade tex archive macros latex contrib biblatex doc biblatexpdf section corporate authors and editors corporate authors and editors are given in the author or editor field respectivelynote that they must be wrapped in an extra pair of curly braces to prevent data parsing from treating them as personal names which are to be dissected into their components example author {{national aeronautics and space administration}} in jabref the latex unicode formatter is called for every field and the formatter now receives the string toconvert {national aeronautics and space administration} the latex unicode formatter now kills the curly braces as they could indicate some latex commands and returns string converted national aeronautics and space administration jabref now splits the author according to it rules and thinks its in this case two authors separated by authors the only solution i see is to check if its a corporate authors convert it to unicode and add the braces again one really difficult edge case is for example author {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{} could be easily interpreted as corporate authorsi hope my long explanation helps you a bit to understand the problem maybe you come up with an idea hello k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz thank you for your work in fixing this issue and thanks for that informative context siedlerchr thats a very interesting edge case i think there could be a test where braces are counted to corroborate that the brace at the very beginning is not closed earlier on that would be the case where formatting as a corporate author would apply i think i have some code in python that does something related though the opposite it matches the most ancient parenthesis first ill adapt it when i

siedlerchr thank you for the overview and the biblatex manual link i have been looking for that one ooi am going to stay out of the biblatex discussion for now because i believe kurt {g\od}el should be kurt gödel it doesnt mean i am not interested in the issue just that i have a lot of reading ahead of me apparently a lot have changed since and bibtex k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz youre welcome im glad to have helped pinpoint this and thank you for taking on this issueand thats great siedlerchr im happy that it seems that this may not need extreme refactoring thats a very clever functionhowever i think i found an edge case where isincurlybrackets may present a false positive in its current form inspired by the corporate author kurt gödel society but instead using łukasz michał as part of a corporate author name im not familiar with jabrefs whole codebase so mismatched braces may be caught earlier on as per https githubcom jabref jabref blob e f a cb dc ea e ed c e src main java org jabref logic

brackets are not respected in the maintables author column is the same as issue should i leave it alone in this pr or update this one to close both since they are related you can update your pr to close both just add it also to the changelog then i am having issues finding a case that is supposed to break the method fixauthornatbiblatexfree ill look at it a bit longer before extending the same tests to the other methods but i dont think i will come up with anythingother than that i cant find any tests for bibentrytableviewmodel nor maintablenameformatter i dont think i should attempt to create any as at least bibentrytableviewmodel has gone through quite a bit of changes recently if you cant find a case thats breaking the test its a good sign regarding tests for other classes i think this would be beyond the scope of the pr here k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz as you now have some more deep insights into the bibtexkeypattern generation now than i can you maybe help that usere here in the forum https discoursejabreforg t help with regex in key generation sure i will look at it i somehow missed that jabref has a forum oo so what remains are preferences no longer updates without restart eg from none to natbib that is not within the scope of the pr and i am guessing someone is fixing it already weird things happens if you try to escape curly brackets in the author section of required fields i am guessing the \ is being protected somewhere i can open up an issue about it but i dont have time to look at it until the th of may thanks already for your contribution and the extensive tests just let me know if its finished so far then we can review it it would be nice if you could open an issue for the two problems especially that preferences reloading i guess escaping the curly brackets should hopefully be not that common in the author field more relevant for the title field or so i guess i just saw two minor style issues nitpicks but nothing importanti am trying to learn and improve nitpicking is appreciated and encouraged k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz big thanks for your work on thisi just noticed some latex commands are not cleared in the now master buildhas this been an issue before is this still an issue with latex unicodeadapter image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom db d a c ea c b b b e ef png test library is jabrefauthors in src test resources testbib which file in particular and which settings entry table format of author and editor name hum i am not sure what is going on ill have a look most of those should be cleared and are cleared when i build

calixtus do you have show names unchanged activated i think i could reproduce calixtus screenshot in jabref ffa cd but right now i seem unable to do so again and i have tried k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz if

similar in maintablenameformatter calixtus i thought the intent of that option was to leave the names completely unchangedalso if you change that dont forget to add a cacheeditwith cache i mean something along the line of private string authorsnatbiblatexfree in authorlist uh im not going to change anything today 😄 i was just wondering about that hum actually that is my bad jabref does indeed clear the latex even when show names unchanged is set should i open up an issue and fix this then yes it would be nice if you could provide a fix no need to create an issue before ok i apparently dont know how to do this i created https githubcom jabref jabref pull https githubcom jabref jabref pull well thank you all for reviewing this pr it is very appreciated ❤️ 🎉 🎈ill take the

bibtex key curly brackets are not respected in the maintables author column fix to the prepended null what is going on bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets eg {the school of life} the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key eg null if there is no name why is it going on academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg royal institute of technology the school of electrical engineering and computer science which generateinstitutionkey shortens to riteecs fix replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys eg the school of life l what are alternatives regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of the school of life would be abbreviated to sl instead of l fix to the author column when the list of authors gets converted to a latex free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex free string is used to create fetch an authorlist it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone what i think is left to do x find out why {the school of life} isnt respected in the author field of the gui x attempt to match universities etc with regex assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities x update bibtexkeygeneratortest as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file x see if the readability of generateinstitutionkey can be improved x

im waiting for gianlucabaldassarre to answer in the issue thread seesms not to work type randomly in the comment field and create new lines etc and type againhit ctrl s cursor jumps again to the beginning siedlerchr ok so i wait for updated versions seesms not to work type randomly in the comment field and create new lines etc and type again hit ctrl s cursor jumps again to the beginning siedlerchr just put me on a track the issue occurs now if you save after creating a new line in saving the fields are trimmed of whitespaces this should do the trick lets wait for the deployment mhhh this looks dangerous not sure what consequences could arise when the field value and textfield value are different even if it just whitespace difference what about moving the trim from saving to the set field value method in bibentry ok maybe this also doesnt work since then users cannot type anything with spaces at the end because they are immediately deleted damn another idea preserve the caret position by hand as in https stackoverflowcom a if they really differ only by trimmed whitespace the new caret position should be easy to calculate tested it from eclipse does not change anything caret still jumps to the beginning system jabref pullrequest windows amd java if it can help with the problem sorry if this is naive by directly typing into the multi line tab {} biblatex source with field the problem of jumping is not there maybe you could use the same code used there for the fields showing the problemmoreover i just discovered that typing into the multi line fields as abstract and comment those with the problem you have you have a lag for which if you type fast you cannot see what you are typing a problem you do not have when directly typing within {} biblatex source where typing is a much smoother normal experience next round of testing https buildsjabreforg pull merge grin thank you all for your patience this bug seems to be somewhat tricky to catch expected behaviour should be now after bcc b while editing the contents of the editor field should always remain the same including whitespaces etc after changing the entry and saving the contents are trimmed gianlucabaldassarre thanks for the note the source editor is using a different kind of entry editor called richtextfx or to be exact codearea this editor has higher demands on memory and processor time so we try to use this only when necessary hm i tested your latest changes on this branch for me its still happening i really dont get it it worked for me maybe you something i dont see yetcan you

hard coded https githubcom openjdk jfx blob master modules javafxcontrols src main java javafx scene control textareajaval but jabref uses osnewline upon save oh no that raises more problemsso the basic solution should actually be right now its about how the textarea is compared to the newvalue should be enough to replace in the string every osnewline with \n thinking about it it might also be the reason for some of the library has been modified by another application issues https githubcom jabref jabref issues maybe we should rethink the newline handling on save should we always save in the os specific format and rework it on loading i think this demands a more serious discussion moreover i just discovered that typing into the multi line fields as abstract and comment those with the problem you have you have a lag for which if you type fast you cannot see what you are typing a problem you do not have when directly typing within {} biblatex source where typing is a much smoother normal experiencethe reason for the lag could be the preview window could you please try to deactivate the preview window in preferences preview restart jabref and try again yes i confirm that typing is smooth if i deactivate the preview window inpreferences preview as you suggestedhowever having the preview on the right of each field tab is quiteannoying at least for me for two reasons it takes a lot of space from the field windows and why should i need tocontinuously see the preview the preview flickers while you type anything your corner eye sees itand this is highly annoying distracting indeed peripheral vision hasevolved to be strongly sensitive to changes an observation suggestion that maybe might be used to solve both theproblem of flickering and of the updating of the preview window creating ahorrible lag on typing you could change the program so that the content ofthe preview is updated only when you change field or when you do a similaroperation that means you have finished to update the field rather thaneach time that you type something indeed updating the previouw iscomputationally complicated and causes the problems above and one does notactually need a preview that is always updatedi understand that the on line update of the preview looks cool but if itimpairs the key functionality of being able to type the fields smoothly and it prevents the use of the handy preview window functionalityit is surely not worth iton thu may at carl christian snethlage wrote moreover i just discovered that typing into the multi line fields as abstract and comment

far i only noticed one failing test you have to add the medra fetcher to the test array in orgjabreflogicimporterwebfetcherstest could you also please add one test case to the existing doi fetcher to check that it returns the correct value from medra ok i added a test case to doifetcher passedregarding the test array in orgjabreflogicimporterwebfetcherstest if ive correctly understood the logic i

once your pr is merged in master it will be available in the next automatic build of development version https buildsjabreforg master i think something went wrong with the merge of master into this branch need to investigate manually before merginggeneral remark the discussion in this pr seems to be long are respective code comments added might it be necessary to add an adr https adrgithubio madr hi koppor thanks for the feedbackone of the last commit was rejected with non fast forwarding error so i tried to pull the medra fretcher branch back to local and then push back only the last changes could this have messed up something and most important is there anything i should could do for example creating new branch and work the implementation thereabout comments i inserted a few lines in the code where i thought they could have help is this you are referring toabout adr probably i need some more instructions is it something i should do on my ownthanks again live update this commit is ok https githubcom jabref jabref commit d cc b e ec d b ecc this one is not https githubcom jabref jabref pull commits fc f cb c bd f ef d adb b have to think longer of how to solve itregarding the adr the adr is something signifcat which cannot be put into a javadoc comment alone i think your doi regsitry thing is something like that maybe its engough to have it in the javadoc comment in this case as its not such a significant thing such as selecting a build tool see https githubcom jabref jabref tree master docs adr for adr examples last commit https githubcom jabref jabref pull commits a ddf a df ab e b with some git magic i created f aab which should revert all wrongly added changesnow im going to review mind why did you close this pr did you delete the branch i think it should only be necessary that you pull your branch hope i did not confuse you that i updated your branch i haven’t done anything i was just moving through the comment in the github app form mobile it’s strange i didn’t close it or i haven’t done it intentionally what should i do should i reopen it just clicked on reopen pr and everything is back to normal hopefully 🎉 with a git pull you should get the fixes in locally i must thank you for the time you spent on this really i do sincerely appreciate your comments because that’s what i need and i understand your point i will work on them thanks for your contribution mind and the quick follow up we hope you werent frightened by our reviews and we hope you will continue contributing shit saw this only after merge orgopentest

allowed to depend on orgjabreflogic expected but was anything i should dothis happened when i moved the getagency from doifetcher to doi the idea behind our high level architcutre https devdocsjabreforg getting into the code high level documentation is to have the model as model package we are aware this leads to an anemic domain model https wwwmartinfowlercom bliki anemicdomainmodelhtml not sure whether downloading things should be part of a model think this is a devcall thing we should discuss whether we want to undo the seperation of model and logic what are our limits in model stefan kolb as the build is broken now i would vote to simply change it back to the original eg move the agency fetching back to the fetcher what should i do now mind just create a

authors names this can leave unbalanced brackets if a name piece starts with a latex command as it is not the intended use of the methodthe suggested fix is to resolve latex in the name of an author and then remove any illegal characters in the post processing which is dependent on if it is going to be used as a file path or citation key as unicode characters are already allowed in the name of an author this change should not affect users too much it will however have slower performance as all authors are being processed as if they contain latex in almost all cases that contain latex it will produce different output than the previous solution as always these are only suggestions any comments and criticism are encouraged the intuition behind the suggestion is that latex in strings will always be hard to deal with and i think most users expect a pattern to resolve to something as similar as possible to what is shown in the main table what remains x verify that the citationkeygenerator does not output unicode keys x remove the latex_to_unicode modifier as it should not be used x change access modifiers for methods in bracketedpattern id suggest that most should be private or protected x change how arguments are parsed for auth ed patterns readability x add test cases for this issue x test for character classes in regexp fix parsing of bracketed patterns fix the conversion of unicode to characters allowed in bibtex keys in citationkeygenerator change in changelogmd described if applicable x tests created for changes if applicable x manually tested changed features in running jabref always required screenshots added in pr description for ui changes checked documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not created an issue at or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository a test case for this particular issue where starting brackets can cause a problem will be added it is just taking a bit of time since i havent been able to spend as much time on this as i would have wanted 🙁 id argue that it is motivated to make several methods in bracketedpattern private but then test cases in citationkeygeneratortest depends on them being public a lot of refactoring for your discussion of the consequences maybe an adr https adrgithubio madr could be the proper formati should have written most of the pull request in adr format the issue of unbalanced brackets is adressed by converting all authors names to unicode however id benefit from a second and or third opinion at this point several cite key patterns do not work as expected when names containing latex are converted to unicodeexample auth for gödel would result in goe authn should get the first n character of the authors last namei extended the workaround that already existed for authn https githubcom jabref jabref blob d ef d a c c ae d fc src main java org jabref logic citationkeypattern bracketedpatternjaval l to several other auth edt patterns and i will update those patterns in the documentation if this solution is acceptable an alternative would be to extend the workaround from authn to all author editor patterns which would give more consistent results all authors names will contain replacements for unicode characters for files directories and cite keysthe issue where bracketedpattern cant use unicode because of restrictions in citationkeygenerator can be avoided entirely by preprocessing the bibentries in citationkeygenerator but i dont feel i can adequately judge the advantages disadvantages of the different solutions that would accomplish this so id rather leave it to someone else if there are future issues complaints so the alternatives are leave the behaviour as is replace all unicode characters for patterns that requires the number of character to be known in advance replace all unicode characters in all patterns with authors names i d maybe th i can continue attempting to fix this properly allow unicode in all patterns for bracketedpattern and disallow for citationkeygenerator but it will result in even more work for a reviewer thank you for the longer explanation now i begin to understand what your are really adressing your pr was full of good code style improvements which ditracted me to focus on the underlying issue context for others the pr addresses the issue that the patterns are used for something diferent than the bibtex key generation label pattern documentation at https docsjabreforg setup bibtexkeypatternskey patterns our patterns have magic built in such as shortening each element to n letters we dont offer a streaming approach as crush https githubcom liljencrantz crush does just linking for presenting an idea not applicable as solution in this context i would expect following behavior i when using in the bibtex key generator the non ascii characters are converted to a good representation as in your example göd goe ii when using the pattern in other places the unicode represation is usedreason unicode is working in the year the only exception are bibtex keys because the bibtex tooling is not fully utf biblatex biber is but not the more commonly used bibtex tool thus we will have to add a separate handling herefor case i the author stated latex_to_unicode as you pointed out the length restriction wont work thereto achieve the different handling you already stated the solution entirely by preprocessing the bibentries in citationkeygeneratori like that then the he workaround that already existed for authn is obsolete minor issue is the example of https githubcom jabref jabref issues included in a test case herei think this somehow refs https githubcom koppor jabref issues i think this somehow refs koppor https githubcom koppor jabref issues how 😛 minor issue is the example of included in a test case herethe example relates to bracketedpattern it is my solution of that example that make the consequences for citationkeygenerator harder to ignore which is why my discussion is focused on that parthttps githubcom jabref jabref pull filesdiff d a eec a bc ee a bba r r entirely by preprocessing the bibentries in citationkeygenerator i like that then the he workaround that already existed for authn is obsoletethis is based on my current understanding non trivial which is why i havent done it and why it would require more time from reviewers if i attempt to implement it ill get back with a write up on why but itll be somewhat lengthy hum ill give it a shot and if it is too annoying to review we can just revert it x i have some nitpick comments nitpicking is always welcome i am new enough at this that a nitpick is still a learning experience 😝 tell me if i should focus more on the actual issue since it was is tagged as a high priority bug id like som input on patterns such as auth auth auth based on the coding guidelines https devdocsjabreforg getting into the code code howtosthrowing and catching exceptions i believe they should throw an exception and generate a warning message is this correctthis is relevant as unifying the parsing of the patterns id like it in one spot not three will make it easier to ensure that the unicode ascii conversion use a valid string is it possible to fix checkstyle this does not look good home runner work jabref jabref src

key combinations for new_inbooknew_techreport changed from ctrl to alt it was on purpose to add an additional modifier and not to change the modifier i was thinking that an additoinal moddifier is

happens independently of autosavethe reason why jabref believes that the database has changed is that i wanted to use groupupdatedevent to notify any listener that a group has changed groupupdatedevent extends bibdatabasecontextchangedevent which i guess triggershttps githubcom jabref jabref blob e f a e f f e f fa d ba src main java org jabref gui librarytabjaval l among others i wanted to view it as a change to the metadata the issue with texgroup is that it requires an update without any interaction from the user it updates on changes in an external file and these updates

bibdatabasecontextchangedevent implies a change that requires savingill figure something out but i am temporarily a bit stuck 😱 hum texgroup has a reference to the metadata is it ok if i its eventbus to post updates instead barring changing quite a large part of the code to use observables i saw some discussion regarding this in other issues but i am not aware of if there is a consensus this is my attempt at addressing this issue sorry about the delay and rather large changes doh i just realised a mistake ill have to fix tomorrow it might make sense to make texgroup observable or to use its

indicator nor the badge icon are updated automatically in my situation step build tex file with additional reference observations counter in badge icon for cited entries is not incremented badge icon for cited entries is not highlighted when the bib entry is selected colored group indicator for cited entries is not shown for the newly added reference step update group of cited entries just edit the group of cited entries and save it again when a dialogue appears choose to assign the original groups entries again to this group observations counter in badge icon for cited entries is now incremented properly badge icon for cited entries is now highlighted properly when the bib entry is selected colored group indicator for cited entries is still not shown for the newly added reference step close and reopen the bib file observations everything is shown as expected sorry about that i am using texpad with mac os x and the group gets updated of the aux file as id expect on jabref cf ccould you give me more details on step which application you are using etc and ill try to get a virtual box with ubuntu up and going in the coming days i have used a test tex file with biblatex see first example in https wwwoverleafcom learn latex bibliography_management_with_biblatex the library was configured for biblatex in jabref as well i have used texstudio but i think its independent of this because i have even simply opened the aux file with some editor and i have directly removed or added entries like \abx aux cite{xxx } it seems that the file monitor does not get triggered properly on a file change thus keysusedinaux will not be cleared and the current group bindings are not invalidated directly removed or added entries like \abx aux cite{xxx } it seems that the file monitor does not get triggered properly on a file change thus keysusedinaux will not be cleared and the current group bindings are not invalidatedyup adding removing entries in that fashion works for me in os x ill look into it i dont really have a hypothesis for why it doesnt work in ubuntu yet you are using a local drive not remote is it possible your editor is generating a create event instead of a modify event https stackoverflowcom questions ubuntu java watchservice is broken this doesnt have to be the same issue as with texstudio yes on a local drive you are right i have created a small java test program of your provided link creating the file testfiletxt triggers entry_create testfiletxt editing the file with the simple text editor pluma triggers entry_create testfiletxt if this file is already opened in texstudio and it has been modified within it before it detects the change and it asks whether the file should be reloaded editing the file with texstudio triggers entry_create testfiletxtg entry_modify testfiletxtg entry_modify testfiletxtg entry_delete testfiletxtg entry_create testfiletxt apparently other programs also observe re ceating files since i have never had such problems elsewhere before editing the file with vs code triggers entry_modify testfiletxtentry_modify testfiletxt but when building the pdf file from a tex file with texstudio modification events are triggered with this java program for the aux file entry_modify mainaux modification entries omittedentry_modify mainaux but still no event gets triggered in jabrefthe same applies when editing the aux file with vs code which also triggers a modification event with the java test program but not within jabref tobiasdiez k kaw pnf mkmdsmphz do you think that it would make sense to also observe the entry_create event to make the detection of file modifications more reliable since two out of three of my tested editors trigger the entry_create event and other programs apparently also check on this event yes i guess its a good idea to also listen for entry_create at least i cannot think of a negative sideeffect

testing i found that there two main paths that could result in the same failure the css file being missing before application start and changing the name of the css file while the application is running to resolve the latter i think the best approach is to check the custom css file existsthis is already done for the theme as used for most of the application however the preview viewer has its own css url logicrather than add file checking logic to the preview viewer i have refactored and moved the theme logic of preview viewer into theme so that all css url logic is encapsulated in that class i have also put the logic that checks that the url is valid and filters it to an optionalempty into one new method additionalcsstoload in place of the field of the same name this ensure that the file existence check is performed in all cases rather than just at construction of the theme objecti have kept the optional field so there should be no overhead to this approach for the built in themes and only the minor and necessary overhead of file existence checking for the custom themefor manual testing i checked previews and overall appearance for default theme are correct after restart previews and overall appearance for dark theme are correct after restart previews and overall appearance with a custom theme with a valid name are correct after restart live changes to the custom theme still work in general and for preview rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct before application start the preview is no longer themed but there is no error the preview theme is restored when the filename is restored to the configured value without restarting the application restart rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct while application is running the preview remains themed typically sized css themes are data url embedded and so survive file removal these tests were run both with the gradle run task and on the built binary rationale gradle presents the dark theme as a file while the binary has it built in on a jrt url so the results could be different pr tasks x change in changelogmd described if applicable x

adding a test is this ready nowive justed add some test coverage for theme live reloading the change to it was minor but this should cover all the changes now all being well from ci pipeline i will remove the draft status 👍 i get an npe with the file watching themetest in the github ci pipeline that i dont get when running the test locally and the only thing i can see on the line with npe that could do that is closing the watchservice which functionally looks correct but perhaps is open to memory consistency issues so ive added volatile to the watchservice and i take a local copy to null check before closing in commit d c f b f a b e ive put a condition on that last test ive added so it only runs on windows ill try to figure out why it is behaving differently in the pipeline without holding up this pr as it is very likely a test artifact its quite complicated with needing to run up the file watching service and mock the javafx sceneive given a final quick manual test after the last commitfetcher tests fail with too many requests probably just because im hammering the ci and this is usual i guess the failing of the authors is usual for a first contribution so nothing to worry aboutonly thing that i am unsure of is why the mac osx create installer task fails consistently if thats something i need to fix let me knowfrom my perspective happy for this to be given a final review and merge 👍 docrjp the mac os will always fail because it requires some keys secrets however githubaction does not pass these to forks linux and file watching locking is a complex issue linux file system works completely different from windows eg there is no kind of lock for a filefetcher test are another non related issue only relevant if you worked on them i agree with tobiasdiez we should merge this one now as this is an improvement already bug has been fixed and especially extracting theme logic out of foreign classes is very good even though the theme architecture is not perfect but this goes beyond this pr codewise looks good also to me tests have passed so ill merge this thank you for your work here and for accepting our commnts about it i hope you liked working on

done as expected though please let me know if i need to change update anythingthe fixed version behaves like this if preferences citation key patterns overwrite existing keys is unchecked generatekey in citationkeygenerator overwrites the default citationkey with an newly generated one only if it is blank the default citationkey is not overwritten anymore and therefore stays the same if it is not blankbehaviour remains unchanged if overwrite existing keys is checked let me know if i misunderstood how this feature was supposed to work in general and ill adapt the behaviour accordingly fixes

changes checked documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not created an issue at or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository thanks a lot for your pri think using the setting citation key patterns overwrite existing keys might be confusing this is used to warn prevent users if they try to generate a key using the generate key button in the entry editor although the entry already has a key the use case is that after generating a new key old latex documents stop compiling and some users would like to prevent this as you see this has nothing to do with the importmaybe its better to add a checkbox in the import dialog another idea would be to let the users specify a cleanup preset in the preferences that is applied after an import the latter would then also resolve lucasf jabref developers what do you prefer oh ive completely missed the mark then sorry about thatthe way i understood the description discussion within the issue i presumed the overwrite existing keys option was the one that governs whether the default citationkey of an imported entry is overwritten by a generated key based on user preferences or not and wasnt working as intended my badjust for my understanding in general if the bibtex source string article{igor eha author {igor kulikov} title {a new gpu accelerated hydrodynamical code for numerical simulation of interacting galaxies} year { } month { } archiveprefix {arxiv} eprint { } primaryclass {astro phim}} is being imported after a web search default behaviour would be to overwrite the citationkey of the bibentry object with a generated key based on the pattern specified in citationkeypattern preferences eg igor in case of a default pattern of auth year if a user were to choose not to overwrite keys the bibentry would continue using igor eha as its citationkey would that then be considered intended behaviour for an importim afraid im not able to fully comprehend the cleanup preferences solution youve mentioned so im definitely not fit to voice an opinion here ive just got a first very localised look at jabref while attempting to fix the mentioned issuenot sure about the protocol would you like me to close this pr and await your decision on this topic another idea would be to let the users specify a cleanup preset in the preferences that is applied after an importi like this option i think it would address a lot of the confusion regarding when the citation key generator is used and what behavior it hashowever i dont think it replaces this pr i think there is a need for a default global citation key generation behavior which in my opinion should be set in the citation key patterns preferences i consider the unwanted characters another example of when a default option is necessary and should be applied wherever whenever the citation key generator is used oh ive completely missed the mark then sorry about that the way i understood the description discussion within the issuei dont think there is such a thing as missing the mark when it comes to jabref when something leads to an improvement i think everything is up for discussion and on the mark 😛 overwrite existing keys option was the one that governs whether the default citationkey of an imported entry is overwritten by a generated key based on user preferencesid argue that this is the case cleanup preferences solution youve mentioned so im definitely not fit to voice an opinion herei interpret it as essentially running a cleanup action on the imported entries perhaps using different preferences but otherwise same as the from my point of view as i proposed in https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment it needs to the check needs to be added to the import handler before the key generator is called from my point of view as i proposed in comment https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment it needs to the check needs to be added to the import handler before the key generator is calledam i reading too much into your comment in that you are aligned with the add a checkbox in the import dialog optionin my mind the logic is that a citation key generator object is created based on preferences citationkeypatternpreferences if the importer wants to override these settings it should create a new instance of this object then it is up to the citationkeygenerator to adhere to these preferences admittedly this doesnt work well with shouldwarnbeforeoverwritecitekey perhaps i am just overcomplicating things and thinking about this in the wrong way indeed there is no such thing as missing the mark in our cosy jabref worldthere are two things here that we shouldnt confuse use clicks generate citation key button controlled by the citation keys overwrite existing keys preference automatically generate keys upon import web search instead of using the one provided by the fetcher which most of the times is some cryptic key although from a code point of view they are the same for a user they are quite different and one could easily imagine that a user might want to prevent overwriting manually set keys but still would like to have automatically generated keys upon importi think the best way forward would be to introduce a new preference setting generate new key on import that could go in the general tab below the other import related preferences entry owner time stamp or if you feel comfortable enough with the code create a new preference tab import where you put all of these preferences options maybe calixtus has more input about the structure of the preferences thank you all for the explanations comments i feel like ive got a better idea about the subject id have to take a closer look at the project again to see whether i feel like id be able to implement the create a new import tab in preferences solutioni was wondering though wouldnt the option to decide whether or not to generate a key for a given import in the import dialogue be advantageous as well on top of the new entry in preferences this way a user wouldnt have to change their preferences when importing an entry for which theyd like to go against said preference as long as im not confusing things again i agree that such an option in the import dialog might be handy from time to time however this also makes the import dialog more complicated so im not sure if its a good idea to add it there maybe first try the solution via the preferences and then see if the users would like to have an option during the import as well lucasf it would be really nice if you could go with the simple solution first that would be a huge benefit already for many users we can always add an option in the import dialog later it seems im unable to accomplish even that im afraidive managed to add an import settings tab as well as a checkbox for toggling the option by attempting to copy how other tabs are implemented so nothing to write home about at all image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ade eb e b ef fffb png the feature as such seems to be working as well but its messing with something or more like breaking something and i have been unable to understand what exactly it is image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom cddbe ade eb fce d b b ca png these exceptions are raised once you have toggled the checkbox in the import settings at least once in a session as soon as you delete the last remaining entry within a libraryif the setting has not been changed in a session no matter if the option is enabled or not these exceptions are not raised when deleting the last entry in the libraryhowever the more often you toggle the option the more exceptions are thrownexample after having toggled the setting three times image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom be adf eb b e afpng didnt want to push the branch in its current broken state thanks for your continued work on this looks already pretty good concerning the error message could you copy & paste the complete stacktrace moreover it would be good to have the code with your changes at hand could you maybe push them to a different branch heres https

code i think the issue is not coming from your changes it looks like there is an issue somewhere in the entry list code and you just found a way to trigger them in fact such issues have been reported before we just didnt had a way to reproduce themso i would propose you push your changes to this pr we merge and then have a look at the exception later i kinda forgot about merging pushing sorry about that if further changes improvements are required preferred let me know looks very good although i maybe make some little rewordings before merging this to fit to the name conventions of jabref thank youmaybe well reorganize the preferences soon there is already another pr in waiting with a preferences option that would fit in this tab

change in changelogmd described in a way that is understandable for the average user if applicable tests created for changes if applicable no tests were not created do you have gui tests there is a known problem merge citations does not save the information needed to find the optional extra info like page reference stored in document properties when reestablishing the individual references in uncombinecitemarkers getuniquereferencemarkname may or may not return the original name when it does not the extra info may be lost or even taken from another entry a solution could be to encode the number making the originals unique in the merged name in stead of jr_cite_ _xx ayy it would be eg jr_cite_ _xx a _yy apart from construction and parsing probably marking or calulating the originals as in use for getuniquereferencemarkname would be needed another problem combinecitemarkers orders the merged entries by year i am not sure why the original order is lost in summary the presented solution although improves the situation does not cover all aspects x manually tested changed features in running jabref always required x screenshots added in pr description for ui changes jabref unmerge citations https user imagesgithubusercontentcom fc eb d c b png checked documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not created an issue at or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repositoryhttps docsjabreforg cite openofficeintegration does not mention the merge citations buttonthe most appropriate addition would probably go under the known issues sectiondescribing the two problems above or the original if the proposed changes are not applied thanks for your contribution codewise looks good to me so fari think it would make sense to change the cite generation to encode the unique thing when combining but then the parse ref names needs to be adjusted as well and many other cases as well i think it would make sense to change the cite generation to encode the unique thing when combining but then the parse ref names needs to be adjusted as well and many other cases as welli started a new branch to reorganize oobibbasejava at https githubcom antalk jabref tree improve reversibilityso far it should contain no changes to user visible functionalitymainly reorganization of the code parsing of ref marks is now only in parserefmarknameand isjabrefreferencemarknameon the other hand reorganizing means lots of changesmany of which may seem or turn out to be superfluoussince i am editing while trying to understand what is going oni am worried that with so many changes i end up withsomething that will not be merged due to the amount of changesplease let me know what to expect and what to watch out for probably the best would be to merge this one and you keep working on your branch but try to focus on one issue change per commit so we can understand what you changed commit by commit you can also label your pr as wip and draft growing as you work on it and we check regularly in and have a look at your changesyou can even comment on your own code in the files changed tab so you can discuss your

and body void f x y z throws xexception yexception zexception { body here } void f x y z throws xexception yexception zexception { body here } im sorry but i disagree with all of your suggestions and prefer the current jabref code style jabref developers it is better to keep params short so you could also extract the long param to a var totally agree with the given rationale why inner braces should not be used your case to restrict use of vars should be a rare exception and youre better of to extract that into a function then might look nice but leads to a lot of refactorings when you add a new assignment we wanted to kep the number of unrelated line changes in diffs low to make it easier to review prs of course only a preference but we stick with the standard java code style here to add the brace in the same line might be too restrictive in oyur example but also here we tried to keep the number of rules low and simple without exceptions im sorry but i disagree with all of your suggestions and prefer the current jabref code style jabref developersit is ok i do not expect or suggest to change jabref code style just shared my preferences i accept the rules even if i do not always think they are optimal i am not a maintainer here or elsewhere thus probably underestimate the probability and burden of merging conflicts i am aware of this so i do not intend to shape your code style to my preferences you can import jabrefs code style in intellij and thank you for this suggestion installing idea helped a lot to find a styleaccepted by the checker thanks again for your

linked after changes file added https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ae c a eb fc ae b cba png hi folks thanks for your contribution at very first sight i like this ideaabout the icon this seems ok just a few days ago we switched our iconset to iconli the previous iconset was very limited so the briefcase icon was just a workaround the new icon seem reasonableabout the label im not really sure if we should display an icon or a label maybe the other jabref developers have a preference but if we use a label it needs to be localized see https devdocsjabreforg getting into the code code howtosusing localization correctly hello calixtus tobiasdiez recommended an implementation with a description that says auto in issue we agreed that it would make the display clearer and chose to implement it as a separate text field in the hbox as the description is currently bound to the linked files description property we estimated that too much refactoring would be required to initially set the description to auto and then change it to be bound to the files description property if the user chooses to link the file we also thought that it made more sense to display the text prior to the file name well await feedback from another dev about the icon vs text dilemma thank you for your quick response i did not see the discussion with tobias diez earlier sorry but if thats what you both agreed on than its perfectly fine well try out a few solutions and update the thread with screenshots of the different results then you can give feedback and well go with whatever looks best to you guys after pressing button screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom cd da eb c c e f da png button to the left screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c f d da eb a f dd

tobiasdiez here are some examples of the possible implementations that you suggested earliertell us what you think we can of course make further changes if you want thanks a lot i like the button to the left solution the most and would say it should be sufficiently clear that this is not a normally linked file so if there is a short description as a tooltip for the link button i would say this is fine jabref developers what do you think the tooltip is unchanged since the earlier button as we thought it was well formulated and descriptive im really not sure what would be the best solution on one hand it shows now symbols to the left and to the right and its hard to guess what means what on the other hand it really should stand out if there is an autolinked file guess there is no right solutionwhat if there are more than one linked files listed calixtus different entries are handled separately we simply make use of the isautomaticallyfound property to make changes several automatically found screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c beb fee eb e a a e png one added screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ca cbd fee eb db fc png calixtus different entries are handled separatelyof course its just about the look and feel if several different list entries are shown thanks for testing out i personally like the variant icon on the very left do we use opacity and what percentage would you like currently we use for automatically found files and for files that have been added its just fine as it is if you use opacity please also check out if it shows up right in the dark theme it works for dark mode ill push the latest changes screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f ff eb ca ffa eabpng i realized that opacity was set way too low and that the correct images should be screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e f ffc eb be bcd f png screenshot from https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e ffc eb e c eb e png this is how it looked in the first set of images with opacity we will write some tests for this as well if you like one more more idea on this the königsweg would be to assign a css pseudostate so the opacity would be addressable in the stylesheet and be customizable see for example importentriesdialog initialize lines and this way you could subscribe in the view easybind changes of isautomaticallyfoundproperty to the pseudo class and remove the opacityproperty which is some kind of a rule breaker of the mvvm design pattern kings trail has a different meaning in sweden https enwikipediaorg wiki kungsleden highly recommended hike 😃 otherwise i agree wouldnt say so both the kungsleden and using psuedo classes for opacity are distinguished by special beauty 🙈 😆 we did not manage to figure out how to use easybind but the program now makes use of css to change the opacity when the text is generated and when the button is pressed calixtus tobiasdiez thank you for your time and engagement we appreciate all the help and advice you have given us i have just tested it nicethank you

making repeated group names first class citizens in jabref allowing to create them in the gui with a warning of course it seems suitable for many users as judged by group interface discussions and does not bring any undesired consequences i played for a while with it everything works as expected assuming you are fine with the fact that two groups with the same names contain always the same

in pr description for ui changes checked documentation https docsjabreforg is the information available and up to date if not created an issue at or even better submitted a pull request to the documentation repository sg not yet but will do later thanks for your prjust a few questions i had while thinking about this what should happen if the user renames one of the groups if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no items i think its already possible to have to groups with the same entries group a is an assign entries manually group and group b is a keyword based group for the field groups and value the name of group a the only constraint is currently that group a and group b have to have different names but something as group a dup as a workaround doesnt seem to bad does this work is it already sufficient what should happen if the user renames one of the groups if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no itemsa decent and easy strategy would be to detect this case and leave the old group name as well as the new group name in all entries of the original group then both the new renamed group and the old group will contain the same entries and from the point of renaming they start their independent life so to say amending the rename code should be easy i can do thata more elaborate solution would be to ask if a user wants to reassign the entries to the new group to the old group s or to all of them similar to the question that is asked when changing group hierarchical content but this is more work so the first try would be to leave entries in both old and new group as by default i think its already possible to have to groups with the same entries group a is an assign entries manually group and group b is a keyword based group for the field groups and value the name of group a the only constraint is currently that group a and group b have to have different names this is exactly what i am trying to avoid i mean i try to remove this constraint and allow users to create groups with identical names if they wish so but something as group a dup as a workaround doesnt seem to bad does this work is it already sufficientwell for my purposes of using jabref no it is not sufficientthe primary need is to allow identical group names in different parts of the hierarchy without this i just can not use the groups of example i can not migrate automatically my bibliographies from zotero where i do have identical group names in different parts of the tree and migrating our old jabref x group assignment is also not possiblethe fact that two groups with the same name always get the same entries is for me an u ticipated feature which can be put to good use once you understand it actually think about groups not as tree leaves but as _sets_ in a mathematical sense a set group is defined by its members and the same set can be a member of any other sets eg branches of a tree if i need to define a special group of a different kind then ill probably find it too complicated to maintain and will not do it think what happens when i rename your primary group group a all my symlink keyword based groups group b and friends will become invalid unless jabref fixes them automatically and how does it know when to fix keyword groups and when not most often when i change a keyword in an entry this means that it must appear in a different keyword group not that the original keyword group is retargetted to a new keyword what should happen if the user renames one of the groups if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no itemsalso removing a group should leave entries assigned to the group if other instances of the same group exist i can take care of this as well im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some cases on the other hand it feels like opening a small box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions say id based or full path of group since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a group name group in tree map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future mainte ce im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib file jabref developers what do you think im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some casesvery much so on the other hand it feels like opening a small box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file it seems to be not that bad actually less dangerous than having full paths in group namesthe mentioned actions seem to make a closed complete set of functions crud renaming a group is pretty much as it is now extension will be if another group with the same name exists leave the old group name in all entries and add the new group name if the group was unique remove old group name from entries add new group name to these entries very natural no information is lost the action is actually reversible the user can later rename the new group again move it in the tree or weed out some entries without affecting the original group deleting the group is very similar to renaming if another group with the same name exists no entries need to be changed otherwise group name is removed from all entriesim now experimenting with this functionality in my branch and will add modifications for and to the pr moving in the tree trivial as it is now just change the position in the list and the indentation number can be done both in gui and by editing sed editing the bibtex file manually editing of the groups tree trivial – just delete one row and insert it in another position if yo want it elsewhere this is how i produced the test cases with identical groups before the patch of this pr was implemented tree editing is independent from entry editing unless you want to rename the group manually and retain all entries in it editing groups in entries exactly as it is now just add a group name you want and you have added the entry to that named group it will appear in all places of the tree where this group is mentioned the entry editing is independent from the treeno dangers seem to be lurking so far also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions say id based or full path of group since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a group name group in tree map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future mainte cethe most painful migration was from groups x to groups where a lot of people including me lost their group assignment data well my day was saved by a subversion repo where all my databases reside and a bunch of unix scripts that restored the group assignments others might have been less luckyi see the group assignment by people to be a very valuable information – a lot of manual work went into assigning and classifying entries and people rely on them when finding information they need quicklyso an information preserving migration strategy will be needed anywaya possible migration would be when migrating from the current pr to a tree where groups in different tree branches are different if the new format supports the linked groups ie groups that all get the same entries when an entry is added to one of them convert synonymous groups to such entries if the new format does not support such functionality just retain groups with identical names and identical sets of entries and warn the user that the behaviour of jabref has changed when migrating from the old group format x to the new one as in this pr if all groups have unique names nothing needs to be changed if some groups in different places of the tree have the same name make only those groups unique by either appending a group parent names as in treatment medicine asthma and treatment biocompatibility surfaces or by appending just a serial number and warn the user about renaming the user can then adjust group names if they wish but must importantly their precious division of entries into groups is not lost im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib filewell even if i go for this i and my colleagues need some reassurance that jabref will keep the present functionality in the future so that our work of adding these groups and assigning entries to them does not go down the drain and keeping such functionality in sight is probably as much work for the jabref team as keeping it with the suggested changes added also if i need to use external scripts editors for managing my bibtex file well its doable but i lose some integration and the nice jabref features like auto fetch of bibliographies and oa papers would be a pity also it does not seem like a good advertisement for a gui program to say well you of course can have this feature but you need to save data open a text editor edit groups by hand watch out the syntax restart reread the data into jabref jabref developers what do you thinkkeen to hear the answers update in commits leading to f b when a group with duplicated name is deleted its name is removed from the entries only when there is no other group with the same name left works for delete group and subgroups command hi folksim trying to run jabref under debugger for this i installed ideac

did you configure it as stated here https devdocsjabreforg getting into the code guidelines for setting up a local workspaceconfigure your idethank you very much the hint helped a lot now im running ok sorry ive overlooked this doc as discussed in i have just noticed that when i rename one of the dupliactes its entries are reassigned to the new group and vanish from all old group duplicates this is not what i and probably most other users would expect the fix should be easy – if the group s with the original name exist somewhere in the tree the old group name should be retained in the entries the entries will thus belong to two groups if one of the duplicates is renamed only of the group name vanishes from the tree it should be removed from the entries as well ill amend the pr to fix thisthe latest commit fixes this issue now entries are not removed from the remaining synonymous groups if one of them is renamed in that case entries become assigned to both groups the new and the old seems like a very natural behaviour to mehow do you find it the more i think about this the more im convinced that it was a bad idea on my side to use the group name as the identifier i propose we drop the requirement that the groups field should be human readable and instead use a unique identifier for each group the groups field in the entry editor would then use a chips view to give a nice ui to manage group memberships jabref developers input very much appreciated as a side note the proposed pr seems to also fix the the more i think about this the more im convinced that it was a bad idea on my side to use the group name as the identifier i propose we drop the requirement that the groups field should be human readable and instead use a unique identifier for each group the groups field in the entry editor would then use a chips view to give a nice ui to manage group membershipsif i may chime in sure if you want to have unique keys identifying your internal objects it is a bad idea to rely on external namesthat said i would not say that your idea to use user provided names as identifiers is so bad it depends on what you want to do if you take users provided group names at their face value as names that users want to use to identify their groups then you current implementation logically follows and also a behaviour suggested in pr logically followsafter a bit of testing and playing around i think i now see the full rationale of placing group names into entries and the emerging behaviour is quite useful – provided that you frankly admit that users can create groups with identical names and gui checks will not stop them note that when we have intermediate groups such as language in computer language sql and data language sql or human language esperanto the language group if it is a union group and has no entries of its own behaves exactly as it used to behave in the old systemmoreover if you have some entries in the language group it makes perfect sense to make a subgroup language others where others will contain all unassigned languages and move all these entries there then the language union group will continue to display all entries as it used before and all other language groups elsewhere in the tree would continue to show the entries in their subgroups a user is free to include groups others into those language groups or not to my taste this is perfectly usable quite transparent and rather useful we discussed this at our dev call we are not sure about the possibly overlooked consequences since we are software engineers we like empirical software engineering ^^ we do the shortcut and started a survey on twitter hopefully many persons will answer it https twittercom jabref_org status we discussed this at our dev call we are

info as suggested by aegit in note to myself for the devcall tomorrow i think i agree with https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment note to myself for the devcall tomorrow i think i agree with comment https githubcom jabref jabref issues issuecomment thanks for the reply waiting for the devcall outcome devcall we accept the risk of some unforseen side effects with the benefit having identical groups working devcall we accept the risk of some unforseen side effects with the benefit having identical groups workingthank you very much for accepting this change you save my year – i start to migrate my groups immediately and will offer the javref dev version to my co workes as soon as the stability issues are resolvedin case there are unforeseen problems for sure i feel obliged

duplicate file with the same content the bib file will has two duplicate files as below file { banerjee a a survey on influence maximization in a social network pdf pdf banerjee a a survey on influence maximization in a social network pdf pdf banerjee a a survey on influence maximization in a social networkpdf pdf} in this issue we want to keep the new file with different contents but delete the same one thus after download a new file we need to first judge whether the file name is the duplicate form like xxx compare to the other files in the target directory if yes then compare the content of these files sharing the similar name if the new file has the same content as one of them then delete it and do not add it to the linked file process to fix the issue the related code is in linkedfileviewmodeljava inside the function download because we suppose that the file has already been download the code should be inside downloadtaskonsuccess we define a boolean function isduplicatedfile in filenameuniquenessjava to judge whether the file is a duplicated one in content if yes the newly downloaded file will be deleted and it will not be added to the linked file in filenameuniquenessjava we also define function named eraseduplicatemarks to change the file name like xxx to xxx and return the same string if it is not in the form of duplicate file name in the boolean function isduplicatedfile it will first judge whether there are other files have similar name with its if do not have return false indicating not duplicate if have compare use comgooglecommoniofilesequal the content of the newly downloaded file with all the files has similar file name if the content is different from all of them return false if one of them has the same content with the new files content delete the new file display warning message and return true to indicate duplication happens screenshot of the result use the following bib file for test
