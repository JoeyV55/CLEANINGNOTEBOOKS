settings project or the launcher project and cleaning settings launcher projects dont work either a separate issue can be created for this and it may be possible to fix this by tweaking the target conditions enabling incremental clean only for the clean target still exists on the build farm i think the quickest way to unblock this would be to move fz dlls to a separate folder even if there are no changes in the project f still does some building for settings launcher but it is quicker than before validation steps performed debug and release f ed many times both launcher and settings worked every time built msi with release multiple times alternated with multiple builds of powertoyssln to confirm deteminism confirmed that the msi builds on the cdpx pipeline msi installs and works fine except fancyzones due to any reason for not opening this against master any reason for not opening this against masteri had created this before the merge ive changed the target branch and synced it with master now ive tested it locally and now incremental builds are much faster lgtmi removed the publish step required to generate all dlls required for msi which also would have contributed to the speed increase we need to look into doing that from the pipeline instead since publishing is required only for msi generation so it need not be a part of the normal dev building cycle the publishing step would be needed for any future net core projects as well arjunbalgovind we still need to be able to build msi locally arjunbalgovindthe dlls required for building the msi are not part of the net core desktop runtime where do they come from arjunbalgovind we still need to be able to build msi locallyfrom the changes currently in master a working msi should build locally although you might have to start from a completely clean solution with the release folder cleared up for some reason it doesnt seem to be working as expected on the build farm arjunbalgovind the dlls required for building the msi are not part of the net core desktop runtime where do they come fromfor net core projects there are a couple issues with just building it normally since net core is designed to be portable net core projects will have a depsjson file which has a list of all the dlls it is linked to and whenever the exe is launched the program first validates that all these dlls are present if you look at the json file it also links x arm and debug versions of all the dlls and we would want to avoid this requirement with the msi even if they arent actually used on the user end this was what had happened in this pr where debug dlls were initially added even though they wouldnt actually be used they were required in the output folder the other issue is that by default for third party nuget packages the dlls are not generated in the output folder and instead the local nuget package on the dev machine is referenced this was an issue in case of launcher since it has rd part dependencies from wox but not an issue for settings the solution to this is to use the publish option on vs to do it manually you can right click the project in vs publish and then set the configuration as a publish profile this also has the option to do a self contained publish to include net core dlls which is what was being done in by publishing you can select a runtime identifier say win x and that makes sure only x dlls are required and debug dlls are not required either it also ensures that the third party nuget package dlls are generated in the output dirthe same issues would probably apply if fz was migrated to net corein the changes currently in master for both settings and launcher we were doing a publish step as a post build event using msbuild however this seems to work perfectly for launcher only if you start from a clean build and it doesnt seem to work as expected on the build farm possibly due to inconsistency between msbuild and vs all the dlls get generated on the build farm and we get an msi but this issue happens publishing using a publish vs task from the pipeline rather than msbuild command might be better option but im not sure what portion of the cdpx pipeline can be modified by us since im not familiar with thatwith the changes in this pr since the post build publish is removed to generate an msi you would have to build solution then right click the settingsuirunner project and publish with the configuration like this image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom b b ea e b bfc bdd dpng and similar the powerlauncher project with a config like this image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c a ea ccc e b e png crutkas looking back at the amount of context i had to provide for the net core project building i think we should reach out to the net core team and find out the best way to build publish the project to get all the required dlls locally and on the build farm perhaps we could publish as an msi installer pre build task instaed perhaps we could publish as an msi installer pre build task instaedby publishing pre build what would happen is the correct depsjson and dlls would be generated but then it would get overridden by the normal build rather than using post build pre build we might have to play around with build targets and somehow get the publish target to happen right after build the problem with making that change at the project side is that it would happen on every build so it would increase the already high incremental build time by publishing pre build what would happen is the correct depsjson and dlls would be generated but then it would get overridden by the normal buildit wont get overriden if we do the pre build for installer project in powertoyssetupsln not the powertoyssln so if we want to build an installer we first build powertoyssln and then powertoyssetupsln the problem with making that change at the project side is that it would happen on every build so it would increase the already high incremental build timei agree its very important to eliminate all unnecessary actions during incremental builds since i assume setting msbuild publish task s outputs isnt practical so msbuild can understand that theres no need to perform a post build event again perhaps we can use the installers prebuild events that way if youre not working with installer the majority of time for most people you wouldnt have incremental build overhead right by publishing pre build what would happen is the correct depsjson and dlls would be generated but then it would get overridden by the normal build it wont get overriden if we do the pre build for installer project in powertoyssetupsln not the powertoyssln so if we want to build an installer we first build powertoyssln and then powertoyssetupsln the problem with making that change at the project side is that it would happen on every build so it would increase the already high incremental build time i agree its very important to eliminate all unnecessary

use the installers prebuild events that way if youre not working with installer the majority of time for most people you wouldnt have incremental build overhead rightah i understand now i got confused and thought you meant the pre build events on powertoyssln yes a pre build event on the installer makes sense ill look into that arjunbalgovind since net core is designed to be portablebut we dont have to make it portable by default we can consider adding a portable msi but out main msi doesnt have to install a portable version arjunbalgovind have you consider this option image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f dd a ea f a b cpng i have tried it but it has always thrown an error for me i could not figure out how to resolve it since the error log doesnt provide enough information enricogior i have updated this pr with pre build publishing on the installer project as suggested by yuyoyuppe and ive verified that the msi works locally and on a vm also verified that the msi builds from the build farm however fz still doesnt work most likely because of this issue i think the quickest workaround would be to move the fz editor output dir to a separate folder if we fix that then all the required functionality to unblock working msi generation will be done let me know if you feel the fz folder change should also be a part of this prone side effect of disabling incrementalclean for the settings and launcher projects is that clean solution no longer cleans those projects and you have to manually delete the output files it might be possible to tweak that somehow and that can be tracked in a separate issue and pri have updated the pr description with all the details of the changes and the known issues another thing that traies pointed out was that because of all the changes recently in the projects if you are trying to validate the publishing and msi generation locally you would most likely have to start off on a fresh clone or do a git clean because it looks like old vs files and package references seem to interfere with the generated output would also like microsoft powertoys invest team to validate that they are able to build the solution and generate msis locally as expected barring the known fz not working issue arjunbalgovindok we can take care of https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues edit if this pr will still be open when we do the work we will open a pr on arjunbalgovind user arbalgov fixdoublecompilesounds good

hotkey and try invoking pt run while settings is in focus by pressing the hotkey multiple times image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a e a f ea a b d d dfpng this also has this start menu issue that users reported when they tried using the kbm workaround for using win key shortcuts for pt run im not sure why runs visibility does not close start menu automatically when triggered from the hook side whereas it worked with registerhotkey side that could be a separate issue which needs to be fixed which need not be in this pr its also odd that when start menu is open launcher opens off center it seems to depend on windows that are openi think the off center issue is because of xaml islands not sure if it is related to this pr somil thoughts hi arjunbalgovind im going to take a look at how fz editor hotkey is effected thanks for the heads up arjunbalgovind it seems to work as expected not sure what is the problem you are describing with this change users can enter windows shortcuts as well however since the fz hotkey works using the registerhotkey api those wont workwindows shortcuts you mean generic win key or existing windows shortcut that will be processed by the system and not passed to fz arjunbalgovind it seems to work as expected not sure what is the problem you are describing with this change users can enter windows shortcuts as well however since the fz hotkey works using the registerhotkey api those wont work windows shortcuts you mean generic win key or existing windows shortcut that will be processed by the system and not passed to fzi meant existing windows shortcuts like if a user tries to set it to win space or something like that it was like this earlier as well but before you couldnt even enter win space so a user would never run into that problem arjunbalgovind in the old settings it was the same and we didnt receive any complain doesnt mean we wont in the future but for now i think we are good yet to look at the code but i observed some things while testing sometimes when i change the hotkey for launcher click somewhere else on the window for it to apply and invoke the shortcut immediately it doesnt work it works the next time i try it this could be because it takes some time to apply not really sure and may not be much of an issue sometimes the pt run window moves slightly off center i repro this more frequently if i change the hotkey and try invoking pt run while settings is in focus by pressing the hotkey multiple times image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a e a f ea a b d d dfpng this also has this start menu issue that users reported when they tried using the kbm workaround for using win key shortcuts for pt run im not sure why runs visibility does not close start menu automatically when triggered from the hook side whereas it worked with registerhotkey side that could be a separate issue which needs to be fixed which need not be in this pr its also odd that when start menu is open launcher opens off center it seems to depend on windows that are open yeah there is some lag when changing shortcuts its because of the file watching mechanism i believe it is present from before this pr i dont know about this one to be honest if its a xaml island issue maybe its fixed by the wpf branch ill look into this one maybe its fixable by changing how setting the run window to foreground works when the shortcut is pressed or something lgtm verified that it works as expected had a small question regarding the expected behavior when the hotkeys are held pressed is it taken as one key press or multiple right now it seems to be taking it as multiple key presses if that is the expected behavior it lgtm keys_pressed https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f a d a ee ea e f f dgif i dont think that behavior is intended ill fix that hi arjunbalgovind im going to take a look at how fz editor hotkey is effected thanks for the heads up enricogior as i reported in issue i am not able to enter win or esc shortcuts in fz editor settings hotkey input this is on all hotkey inputs in settings except kbm hi arjunbalgovind im going to take a look at how fz editor hotkey is effected thanks for the heads up enricogior as i reported in issue i am not able to enter win or esc shortcuts in fz editor settings hotkey input this is on all hotkey inputs in settings except kbm htcfreek this pr will fix the win shortcuts case allowing you to enter it but fz currently does not support using existing windows shortcuts we currently do not support a single key like esc for the hotkey input but we might add that in the future agreed that we should put a better error message than just displaying undefined the changes from this pr will be included in traies can we get this merged in lotta tweaks and i know youre getting ramped off i removed the commit that tried to fix the focus issues that arjunbalgovind mentioned because they werent fixing the problem i also rebased to master and checked it is building the installer properly nowas for the focus issues i think it would probably be best if it is spun out to another pr as it currently stands for this pr trying to hit the shortcut to bring up the launcher prompt while having the start menu open causes the focus to be kept by the start menu this only happens when launching the solution from runner and not when launching the powerlauncher executable directly for some reason traies can you please check if you are facing this issue after as well traies can you please check if you are facing this issue after as wellit is still there after unfortunately somil shall we merge this in there is already an issue to track the start menu focus problem so we could reprioritize that users earlier observed it when they used kbm to remap win r to alt space and open launcher and it happens now with these low level hook changes as well lets get this merged in here arjunbalgovind sure ryanbodrug microsoft can we merge this in these are the things that we need to check after fixing was reported earlier when users used kbm shortcut remaps to open pt run and that issue exists with this as well since we moved to ll hooks we need to validate that the default alt space hotkey override does not take place on os version less than h because powerlauncher should not be working in that case we need to validate that the default alt space hotkey override does not take place on os version less than h because powerlauncher should not be working in that casein reality now that we removed islands it should work much lower the issue then becomes the dual settings work which it pretty costly from a resource stance

4083,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,fix remapping from num lock summary of the pull requestadded a workaround for remaps to num lock key the issue occurred because the num lock key state is set before the key down message is intercepted by low level hooks so even if it is suppressed the num lock key state will still change to work around this whenever a numlock key down message is to be suppressed we additionally send numlock key up key down to make sure that the final state of num lock is unchanged explanation numlock was turned off and user remapped num lock to a when user presses numlock internally it gets set to on key up is passed to release the key and next key down sets the state to off both of these events are suppressed so that they not get sent to any other hooks or the os then when the user releases the num lock key it gets set back to released state pr checklist x applies to x cla signed if not go over here https claopensourcemicrosoftcom microsoft powertoys and sign the cla detailed description of the pull request additional comments since there are multiple places where a num lock key event can be suppressed either in the type key shortcut ui or if num lock is remapped the logic for this workaround was added in the main hookproc method just before sending the return to suppress this was easier since that is the final line of code where all the hook suppressions enter irrespective of the cause of the key suppression to ensure that the workaround num lock events are always suppressed an additional flag was added which is set in the dwextrainfo param when using sendinput in the hook logic whenever an event is seen with this flag it will be suppressed without performing any remap logic validation steps performedtested remapping from to numlock and that numlock works fine if not remapped also tested pressing numlock while on typekey shortcut interface should not affect num lock state when i remap numpad numlock then when i press numpad it still does its original function instead of toggling the num lock keythat happens since we use virtual key codes and not scan codes when num lock is turned on the numpad keys are sent as numpad etc when num lock is off these keys are just detected as their alternate function home end etc and are indistinguishable from the normal home keys in your example when num lock is on the remap will work one time but then num lock is off so the numpad key no longer existsill create a separate issue to track that to see if we can get a workaround for that since its out of scope of this pr since this pr only fixes remappings from num lock to another key when i remap numpad numlock then when i press numpad it still does its original function instead of toggling the num lock key that happens since we use virtual key codes and not scan codes when num lock is turned on the numpad keys are sent as numpad etc when num lock is off these keys are just detected as their alternate function home end etc and are indistinguishable from the normal home keys in your example when num lock is on the remap will work one time but then num lock is off so the numpad key no longer exists ill create a separate issue to track that to see if we can get a workaround for that since its out of scope of this pr since this pr only fixes remappings from num lock to another keysure we can create a separate issue for that the mapping from numlock to other keys works fine but i think its just not about virtual codes and scan codes steps to repro note by numpad i mean the physical key on the numpad remap numpad numlock verify that numlock is on by pressing numpad the number shows up as expected toggle numlock numlock is off press numpad simulates up arrow as expected toggle numlock numlock is on press numpad should toggle numlock off press numpad simulates up arrow key press as expected press numlock should toggle numlock on press numpad should show up but it simulates the up arrow key press for me i have to press numlock again to get the number to show up pls let me know if im missing something when i remap numpad numlock then when i press numpad it still does its original function instead of toggling the num lock key that happens since we use virtual key codes and not scan codes when num lock is turned on the numpad keys are sent as numpad etc when num lock is

num lock is off so the numpad key no longer exists ill create a separate issue to track that to see if we can get a workaround for that since its out of scope of this pr since this pr only fixes remappings from num lock to another key sure we can create a separate issue for that the mapping from numlock to other keys works fine but i think its just not about virtual codes and scan codes steps to repro note by numpad i mean the physical key on the numpad remap numpad numlock verify that numlock is on by pressing numpad the number shows up as expected toggle numlock numlock is off press numpad simulates up arrow as expected toggle numlock numlock is on press numpad should toggle numlock off press numpad simulates up arrow key press as expected press numlock should toggle numlock on press numpad should show up but it simulates the up arrow key press for me i have to press numlock again to get the number to show up pls let me know if im missing somethingi think what happens in this case is that when the numpad key is pressed in step the key down message gets changed to num lock key down but now because num lock is on the key up message would be down arrow rather that numpad which is why pressing numlock the first time it ignores the key down press because the system things numlock is already being pressed down so it needs to be pressed twice if we have logic to say that the down arrow event and the numpad event are same which may involve scan code or some other workaround then that would be resolved but this is again unrelated to this pr since it doesnt change any logic for remapping to numlock created to track the numpad related remapping issue

of the reasons for this to happen was that all the image icons were cached even though the code had an upperlimit on the maxcached values which was set to this part of the code was never called unless powertoys was closed therefore since all the icons were being cached the size of the dictionary continued to increase work around instead of caching all images and increasing the size of the dictionary the following changes have been made reduce the number of cached images to if the number of images increase over the permissible factor set to of the cached images ie then the ones which are infrequently used would be removed from the dictionary and there be images that are cachedthis ensures that the dictionary size is always less than pr checklist x applies to x cla signed if not go

gc that is not something that i have modified it is the default net gc and it might be something that we can look into later gc should be in a background thread and technically not cause any

similar color windows does the opposite of that though agreed that it gives more contrast but it feels different from what i would expect as a windows user alekhyareddy it does seem fair to follow the color scheme same as windows for tooltip i have updated this pr to reflect that also i think we should add prefixes name {app name} and path to the tooltip i will update this once changes for indexer localization in are merged i find it a little unexpected that the tooltip positions itself at the bottom left corner irrespective of where my pointer is im unsure why but on my system it doesnt appear like in the screenshot of this pr in the following image my pointer is right above the button and still the tooltip is on the bottom leftplacement of tooltip is set to bottom when the property is set to bottom it align its left edge with left edge of parent control as mentioned here https docsmicrosoftcom en us dotnet api systemwindowscontrolsprimitivesplacementmodeviewnetcore the reason i did this because default behaviour of aligning with mouse location results in the main text being hidden by tooltip frequently https user imagesgithubusercontentcom abaa f bc ea bc e png im also seeing the tooltip at the bottom left corner as in alekhyareddy s screenshot is that the expected behavior i personally prefer the tooltip being at the mouse position but i agree that might cover the content in file explorer the tooltip appears only if you hover for some time rather than displaying it instantly and it shows it below right of the mouse cursor position whenever possible with the exception of the mouse cursor being at the bottom of the window i agree on the default shell timing that would be nice to havecan we seperate the textblocks for the app title and path as well this would give us the freedom to eg make the title semibold and the path normal im also seeing the tooltip at the bottom left corner as in alekhyareddy s screenshot is that the expected behavior i personally prefer the tooltip being at the mouse position but i agree that might cover the contentit is expected behavior since we are explicitly setting placement to bottom setting it to bottom aligns tooltip with left edge of parent control by default as mentioned here https docsmicrosoftcom en us dotnet api systemwindowscontrolsprimitivesplacementmodeviewnetcore in file explorer the tooltip appears only if you hover for some time rather than displaying it instantly and it shows it below right of the mouse cursor position whenever possible with the exception of the mouse cursor being at the bottom of the window we can change the initial delay in the tooltip and make it similar to windows explorer also the default behaviour of positioning in explorer is to display it below cursor bounding box you will find that it does cover content if you view it on medium size there is not a lot of text on explorer icon so it seems fine even if the content is covered and we can right click to get context menu for explorer but in powertoys run long paths could end up covering both the context menu and text crutkas saahmedm can tell more if we want to prefer one over others somil can you give us an updated screenshot please i want to see how it looks after the changesthank you htcfreek i have updated the description with screenshot of tooltip in both dark and light mode

renamed powertoys run updates itself accordingly pr checklist x applies to x cla signed if not go over here https claopensourcemicrosoftcom microsoft powertoys and sign the cla x tests added passed requires documentation to be updated ive discussed this with core contributors already if not checked im ready to accept this work might be rejected in favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place xxx detailed description of the pull request additional commentsthe changes made in this pr are as follows the win storage list has been modified to use a class called win programrepository which implements listrespository and iprogramrepository just like in packaged applications with this change all the items are stored in a concurrent dictionary and adding deleting indexing all programs has become easier as concurrent dictionary is thread safe we do not need locks while setting deleting items when a win application is added there can be a chance of duplicates to avoid this situation the gethashcode function of win has been overridden so that the custom win gethashcode function is used this ensures that no duplicates are present in the list even when we actively add or delete apps the win programrepository and win programrepositoryhelper classes have been added to watch certain locations and trigger created deleted or renamed events whenever such an operation is performed on a file to prevent these events from being triggered for non app type files we add filters these filters raise events only for those particular type of applications filters https docsmicrosoftcom en us dotnet api systemiofilesystemwatcherfiltersviewnetcore the filesystemwatchers filter out exe lnk appred ms and url type files and call the getappfrompath path function which has been added to the win class this function returns the corresponding win item which can be added to the list wrappers and interfaces have been added to filesystemwatcher systemiofile and fileversioninfo classes so that they can be mocked and tested shelllinkhelper is implementing the interface ishelllinkhelper so that the win shortcut programs lnk can be tested for shortcut apps getappfrompath doesnt give us the expected fullpath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the fullpath is set using the shelllinkhelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the exe fullpath from the lnkfile for deleted apps since we have no more information to go on we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkresolved path for renamed apps we have more information about the existing app so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list this is done so that we have an app which has the same name exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same validation steps performed manually validated it added tests to ensure that the we will not be introducing duplicates for each event {created renamed deleted} and app type {exe lnk appred ms url} a test has been added to validate that the filesystemwatcher work as expected all the other program plugin tests pass as well image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e c e ea d f f ad be png bao qian and jjw this pr may be of interest to you i noticed the following issues while trying this pr results are not updated after a program is installed uninstalled query needs to be manually changed to see updated results for example a type in notion in the search box b uninstall notionexe c press hotkey to bring up the launcher notion is still present in the resultsthis is not related to this pr that is how pt run is the results are obtained once for each query i dont think this is related to this pr the user has to change the query for the results to update this would be the same situation with even uwp applications anything else as well jsonrpc is used to communicate with each plugin for each query and once the results are obtained they are displayed if i abruptly close powerlauncher say by closing debugging session directly the cache for the uninstalled program is still present on the next launch we should verify cache validity on startupyea i think it is a good suggestion apps which are deleted when pt run is not running also show up because of the cache issue i think it is a generic issue and i shall create it an issue so that we can work on it if i rename an internet application it keeps all the previous version as welli tested this out to ensure that this would not happen can you please share information about the app ie lnkresolvedpath fullpath exename so that i can repro it and try to debug i added a program using epic games which installed a url shortcut on desktop but this change is not detectedi tested it out with steam games and it worked as expected i shall try out epic games as wellregarding i think they are not a scope of this pr regarding and i shall look into why thats happening and try to fix it somil i tried installing the same game on the desktop while pt run was executing in the background and it works as expected would be great if you could help me figure out those two scenarios because im not able to repro them thanks image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f c c ea c f cb ecpng regarding we actually do that in certain cases for example when theme is changed query is refreshed to update the theme specific icon this was done in but i agree that can be done as part of separate pr the app in is hangouts chrome extension with the following info lnkresolvepath c \\users\\divyan\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start menu\\programs\\chrome apps\\google hangouts dlnkfullpath c \\program files x \\google\\chrome\\application\\chrome_proxyexeexecutablename chrome exe i am able to repro this issue each time i rename this file please tell me if you need any more information i resolved all the commentsa few things to point out i noticed that we were previously not disposing all the plugins properly we had the code for disposing events in the plugin manager but we had var disposableplugin plugin as idisposable instead of var disposableplugin pluginplugin as idisposable and hence the dispose functions werent being called i fixed that and ensured that all the plugins are being properly disposed of and even the file system watchers are being properly disposed regarding the renaming of shortcut apps i was previously just removing the extension to get the name of the app from the oldname rename event handler args however the name parameter contains the path as well with respect to the directory that we are watching i used pathgetfilenamewithoutextension path and that fixes the issue regarding the url apps showing up sometimes it was because the installation of the game was not yet complete and it was still being written to hence when we tried to call the function readalllines it would throw an ioexception now i have added a retry block after a set amount of time this would not halt anything because it is on the file system watcher event handler thread somil i tried to fix it by adding some retry attempts i have created an issue to look into it can this pr be merged in as it is a huge pr and i need to be resolving merge conflicts i shall look into that issue separately as a part of this iteration

for commandline arguments to the program plugin validation steps performed part ran an uwp program with commandline arguments validate it ran as expected part ran an win program with commandline arguments validate it ran as expected part added unit tests the pr is draft because it needs some work to determine where the searchtext should be resolved to the application and where it would start passing the rest as arguments eg microsoft edge is currently parsed as microsoft for application edge as arguments currently two options seperates search text with argumentlist before a word and not the first text at least second or third what about doing it like windows search accept parameters only when the user enters the exe file nameinput result firefoxexe profile firefoxexe profilefirefox profile no result firefox mozilla firefox htcfreek i dont think this would be great since it will not be possible to launch the programs via their description and do all uwp programs have an exe open question currently i implemented in the following way if the search query contains a use everything behind it as the queryarguments if the search query starting at term contains a or it will parse that rest as query arguments otherwise parse everything to the query and keep arguments emptydoing my own testing now to see how i like the feature you can too and will add tests for the parsers later the pr is draft because it needs some work to determine where the searchtext should be resolved to the application and where it would start passing the rest as arguments eg microsoft edge is currently

edge inprivate found added the tests for it as well search command arguments reason edgeexe inprivate edgeexe inprivate no found and no single dash for arguments edge inprivate edge inprivate found i think the first case should be also possible because for example chrome uses double minus for parameters added support for the doubledash as well and updated the regex to make it easier to add even more but dont think that will be needed i thought the doubledash was more of the linux style of commandline seperators but seems its also used on windows so a good suggestion 👍 royvou i know you were doing some stuff here a while ago can we test this out crutkas yes latest commits were only merges to keep up with the latest master branch 😄tests should now also be ran by ci so thats awesome royvou will we get this in for would be great if yes htcfreek i think this all depends on how much if any feedback well get on this feature 👍 but i assume will be close if everything goes great crutkas were you able to try it out yetyesterday i saw another merge conflict so i rebased it on top of that again crutkas will we get this in for or do we need more time for testing rebased it on the latest master branch to resolve merge conflict on the csproj can we merge this for crutkas have you tried this feature royvou i was testing this due to an old issue i found https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues for cmd this works but for terminal this pattern does not royvou i was testing this due to an old issue i found https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues for cmd this works but for terminal this pattern does not crutkas what command have you enteredi think it musst be written like wtexe ping githubcom crutkas i would need to inspect but since neither use a or with argument i would expect it to be part of the program instead of the arguments current iprogramargumentparser implementation assumes every keyword you type in keywords are seperated by a space eg microsoft edge would be part of the program so wt ping githubcom is determined to be the complete search string which in turn will cause no arguments to be passed in does everything via shell so thats no problem they assume the first keyword you need to escape quote it and it must be an exact match i think theres a few suggestions on how to handle it suggest to users create a special iprogramargumentparser which causes everything after exe so wtexe ping be picked up correctly create a special iprogramargumentparser which special cases known terminals wt pwsh bash cmd change logic to try to search programs in steps would be hard to get right though will update the bug you mentioned later i think are good to add

using light gray dark gray i personally like that look and feel more especially for the colorful iconscould we make these backgrounds rounded cornerradius as well or is that a big undertaking all ui

background right i agree with htcfreek with the latest windows insider builds the start menu is moving away from colored tiles backgrounds in the app list and using light gray dark gray i personally like that look and feel more especially for the colorful icons niels htcfreek background color for an icon is decided based on the following conditions if the manifest for the program specifies a color it is used for example manifest for spotify specifies a ed background apps such as mail maps etc specify d background color i believe these would be accordingly updated in h if the manifest file specifies color as transparent we use accent color the reason we have to use to do this is that apps might have a white icon that becomes invisible with a white pt run theme the messaging app is an example of this i believe this would need to be changed i could think of two possible ways to handle this first would be to use light gray dark gray background instead of accent color second would be to decide this based on the windows version ryanbodrug microsoft crutkas any thoughts on this could we make these backgrounds rounded cornerradius as well or is that a big undertaking all ui elements

woxpluginprogram programs uwpcs this was modified to use plating color as the current windows accent color similar to the start menu if the background color is set as transparent in the manifest file

when this pr is ready the code could be interesting for you for the uri plugin code to plate the icons was added back from wox https githubcom jjw wox blob master plugins woxpluginprogram programs uwpcs this was modified to use plating color as the current windows accent color similar to the start menu if the background color is set as transparent in the manifest file somil as far as i know ms changed the background colour for tiles icons in start menu with h do we need to react on this change somil i have not run it just yet will do that tomorrow but as far as i can tell looking at your code you are using the accent color as the background righti agree with htcfreek with the latest windows insider builds the start menu is moving away from colored tiles backgrounds in the app list and using light gray dark gray i personally like that look and feel more especially for the colorful iconscould we make these backgrounds rounded cornerradius as well or is that a big undertaking all ui elements in run and winui are rounded so it would fit better somil i have not run it just yet will do that tomorrow but as far as i can tell looking at your code you are using the accent color as the background right i agree with htcfreek with the latest windows insider builds the start menu is moving away from colored tiles backgrounds in the app list and using light gray dark gray i personally like that look and feel more especially for the colorful icons niels htcfreek background color for an icon is decided based on the following conditions if the manifest for the program specifies a color it is used for example manifest for spotify specifies a ed background apps such as mail maps etc specify d background color i believe these would be accordingly updated in h if the manifest file specifies color as transparent we use accent color the reason we have to use to do this is that apps might have a white icon that becomes invisible with a white pt run theme the messaging app is an example of this i believe this would need to be changed i could think of two possible ways to handle this first would be to use light gray dark gray background instead of accent color second would be to decide this based on the windows version ryanbodrug microsoft crutkas any thoughts on this could we make these backgrounds rounded cornerradius as well or is that a big undertaking all ui elements in run and winui are rounded so it would fit betteri will update this thanks for pointing out this actually i stand corrected start menu changes to high contrast icons when having the light theme enabled image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom f e d ea b b d dpng image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ae a e d ea fce faf facd png actually search is using accent color so maybe the current implementation is the way to go image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ca ec e d ea e a e b epng martinchrzan can you please unblock this pr if you dont have any other comments somil image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c e f ea be c d d e png seems as if the rounded corners are only visible on the right top and bottom to me the context menus are also using a cornerradius of which look way more rounded i dont see what would be the cause of thisif its a big effort id just go back to sharp corners and we can look at it in a separate pr niels i think we can tackle this issue in a separate pr i will revert the rounded corner changes i have created the following issue to track it https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues royvoupr is ready and committed i think you can use the code for the uri plugin 🚀

an action keyword then only a non global query would be executed however now we have a query being generated for each plugin we execute global plugins along with the non global plugins as we have removed the space requirement following the action keyword a few symbols have been added to the search ignore regex of the indexer plugin the symbols which have been added are cmd the indexer plugin is also executed now and it compared the filenames and returns those which are greated than cmd this was leading to a delay also filenames do not contain these symbols previously there was only one

also filenames do not contain these symbols cmd because of removing the blank requirementcan we do it instead like the following way to avoid adding more symbols to the black list we generate a pair list of all action keywords and corresponding plugins if we find one or more of the keywords on the pair list at the beginning of the search query we only send the search query to the corresponding plugins of the pair list then we dont have to send the query to all plugins to distinguish the words not single action chars for action keywords from search text for plugins we could have the requirement of an colon between keyword and search query this means for example cmd or folder windows previously there was only one query being sent to all the plugins if the first space separated

that you added the to the search ignore list do we get in trouble with this change when users search for files by file pathaccording to windows the file path cannot contain a so we will not get into any issue there rather we wouldbe removing unnecessary queries being sent to the indexer plugin this was added not to blacklist a symbol but rather to improve the performance of the indexer query by removing redundant queries you wrote that you got the result cmdexe while typing cmd because of removing the blank requirement can we do it instead like the following way to avoid adding more symbols

searching for cmd image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e b e ea f bb bpng unfortunately the approach you are suggesting will not work if we set a character set of characters as an action keyword because then we wouldnt be able to search for programs starting with those characterswe can have a colon as you suggested but that defeats the purpose of removing the space if we were to set a colon then we could instead leave the space as is to not complicate how it works we can always tweak the working based on user feedback later according to windows the file path cannot contain a so we will not get into any issue there rather we wouldbe removing unnecessary queries being sent to the indexer plugin this was added not to blacklist a symbol but rather to improve the performance of the

if small enough write a unit test that loads the file and verifies the expected result it looks to me that your just verifying the default values of the serialized save data am i missing somethingmy understanding was that we need to verify that old settings are not overwritten by the changes in current version upon installation of the new version which would be current version for the points that you have mentioned current tests already do that number writing to the file is done via the runner module maincpp we wont be able to do that since we are not using ipc in the unit tests this means that we would have to do it by writing the settings file ourselves which would mean that we are testing whether the settingutilssave method works but we already have separate tests for settingutilssave ryanbodrug microsoft i added test files to the project ryanbodrug microsoft what needs to happen here to get this in a good state for the test to be added in didnt mean to push to this branch marking as draft as these tests dont do anything right now validated that all the tests pass are we planning to add tests for compatibility between the old and new settings as wellcan you be more specific here that is the intent of these tests did i miss something validated that all the tests pass are we planning to add tests for compatibility between the old and new settings as well can you be more specific here that is the intent of these tests did i miss somethingmaybe i missed it but did we use the settings files generated by the older settings process if so please ignore the rest of thisi was referring to this scenario with image resizer so someone might initially be using the older c settings and then when they upgrade their build and use the c settings does everything work as expected i was especially coming from the image resizer side where some parts have been moved to the settings from the img resizer code im not completely sure how the format and where the older settings saved the information for img resizer for most of the powertoys the config is saved using set_config so the format should be the same irrespective of the old or new settings but imgresizer doesnt seem to do that https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src modules imageresizer dll dllmaincppl the new settings process imageresizerviewmodelcs saves the configurations directly without passing them to runner because some options were moved to it so i was thinking it would be a good check instead of maybe creating a new configurations file if there is a format exception ryanbodrug microsoft there are two places where the name of a module is used as the folder name while being stored here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src core microsoftpowertoyssettingsuilib imageresizersettingscsl for imageresizer as information being sent to the runner this https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src runner general_settingscppl is where the name must match the name of the module to enable or disable the powertoyfor most of the powertoys both these values are the same this does not seem to be the case for imageresizer the imageresizer settings storage folder name is imageresizer without the space this would work with the older settings as well because the name accessed directly by imagesizer previously is also without the space here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src modules imageresizer dll settingscppl however while sending information to the runner the name of the module must be image resizer with the space and this is based on the names of the powertoys according to the runner and is followed by the general settings enabled modules config here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob

powertoy for most of the powertoys both these values are the same this does not seem to be the case for imageresizer the imageresizer settings storage folder name is imageresizer without the space this would work with the older settings as well because the name accessed directly by imagesizer previously is also without the space here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src modules imageresizer dll settingscppl however while sending information to the runner the name of the module must be image resizer with the space and this is based on the names of the powertoys according to

powertoys and sign the cla x tests added passed requires documentation to be updated ive discussed this with core contributors already if not checked im ready to accept this work might be rejected in favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place xxx info on pull request_what does this include_the general settingsjson file on being accessed by settings was throwing a file in use ioexception because it was being used by another process the way settings and runner worked before this pr is as follows the settings on start up checks if the general settingsjson file exists and reads from it if not it creates a new one the runner on the other hand during start up does not save to the file apply_general_settings is passed with a false save argument there is no contention during this parthowever the issue occurs when settings tries to open the general settingsjson file everytime it needs information in any viewmodel or converter when any change is made in the settings that information is communicated to the runner and it is the runners responsibility to write to the settingsjson file however since we have one process continuously trying to read from a file and the other writing to the same file there is contentionto fix this issue the following changes have been made rather than adding a retry block everywhere the settings is being accessed the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodels generalsettingsconfig a public static variable the shell page of settings which is the base page loads the general page on start up public shellpage { initializecomponent datacontext viewmodel shellhandler this viewmodelinitialize shellframe navigationview keyboardaccelerators shellframenavigate typeof generalpage } therefore the general page is the first one to be loaded on start up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in its constructor the generalviewmodel tries to open the settingsjson file and loads the information from it if it exists if not it creates a new settingsjson file hence this variable is always initialized when settings is running this is also the only time the settingsjson file is accessed by the settings process and as mentioned above on start up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the generalsettingsconfig in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file might possibly be related to as well even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol validation steps performed_how does someone test & validate_ all tests pass the format had to be changed for initializing generalsettings based on the code changes manually validated in release as well as in debug mode that the crash no longer occurs also validated that the converters work as expected by changing the theme image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e c c f ea e c e a png alekhya is it possible to abstract the data for the generalsettingsviewmodel that is shared across view models into an implementation of an interface that can be dependency injected instead of statically referenced i think this would improve the code in the following ways it facilitates unit testing the various view models that need to react to a particular state of the general settings philosophical point a view model is responsible for providing data to a particular view moving to an interface avoids coupling the other viewmodels to the existence of a particular viewmodel and can encapsulate lazy loading of the information which avoids assumptions of the sequence that other view models get loaded in alekhyareddy what will happen if for some reason writing settingsjson fails in runner the settings ui would display updated values even though they have not been written to settingsjson file or communicated to other powertoys alekhyareddy what will happen if for some reason

why the writing to settingsjson file would fail by the runner i verified that runner writes it as expected if it does then i think it is a bug on the runner end and should be fixed rather than having

synchronize and ensure resiliency wrt to serialization deserialization of the the data individually i think that issue could be treated separately though ryanbodrug microsoft i agree that centralizing settings would tackle these issue and it can be handled separately thanks for your clarification ryanbodrug microsoft ive made the changes as suggestednow we have a wrapper singleton class namely generalsettingscache which has a property commonsettingsconfig these configurations are shared across all the viewmodels ive not touched settingsutilscs and the file handing ipc i was thinking if we need to make any changes to unify that we can do so after we get your refactoring testing pr invalidated the following runner and all powertoys respond correctly to changes in settings settings reads only once on start up from the settingsjson file throughout its lifetime it continues to get information from the generalsettingscache validated that the modelconverter also works as expected and that there is only one instance of the commonsettingsconfig shared across all the viewmodels all tests pass image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom af f ea b eeb e png ryanbodrug microsoft ive made the suggested changes there is now a generic singleton class settingsrepository which encapsulates the disk accessesso any viewmodel can get the settings information using settingsrepository instancesettingsconfig settingsrepository instancesettingsconfig right now fz shortcut guide and power preview use this interface along with generalsettings ive validated the a change in the settings ui in each of these reflects in the actual powertoy other than preview handlers which seem to be on all the time as suggested ive added a lock during initialization of settingsrepository and also added tests for the same to ensure that multiple instances are not created when accessed by multiple threadsi shall look into migrating the other pt settings to this repository once i get a better understanding of the way in which each of them accesses the disk passes the information to runneri hvnt moved the ipc delegates to settingsutils from the view models yet shall do that separately as this pr is getting quite big thanks for patiently reviewing this pr 😄 also to add the getfile function should ideally not be needed in the long run previously getsettings was just reading from a file and did not have a check to see if the file existed or notsince getsettings has been modified to create the file if it does not exist getfile does what getsettings previously used to this is because in two cases the defaultjson file of kbm and settingsjson of pt run these two files are assumed to be created by runner if they dont exist and not settings hence the getfile function was added pulled

tests remapping to disable works because it calls sendinput on word vk_disable sometimes which is interpreted as x which doesnt actually do anything this should be changed so that we do not sendinput on thati think it should map vk_disable to since it is equal to x isnt it it seems like if we decided to treat shortcut disable as key remap and was not concerned with sending key events it would require adding only new disable key without tweaking any existing logic remapping to disable works because it calls sendinput on word vk_disable sometimes which is interpreted as x which doesnt

as key remap and was not concerned with sending key events it would require adding only new disable key without tweaking any existing logic mykhailopylyp right my mistake its x i still think we should avoid sending key events with x since that is an undocumented key code which could have side effects currently xff is the only undocumented key code we use for dummy keys and we have got an issue of a side effect of that on wsl on windows terminal so using undocumented keys could have issues in the future arjunbalgovind i still think we should avoid sending key events with x since that is an undocumented key code which could have side effects currently xff is the only undocumented key code we use for dummy keysi agree arjunbalgovindi think that a good way to fix the following issue is do not show disable in the dropdown do you agree image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ff b eb ed f cc c png https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob c b abd d d f d b a dead a src modules keyboardmanager common helperscppl l along with that i noticed that it would be good to have boxlist of comboboxitem s so we can attach key code as value in that way we can throw away indexes logic so we do not have to rely on the exact order in the two arrays key codes and key code names what do you think it will help if we want to keep different amount of keys in different orders for dropdownsshould we implement it in this pull request or create separate issue mykhailopylyp i think that a good way to fix the following issue is do not show disable in the dropdown do you agreei think that would be the ideal way to fix it but im guessing that might be more difficult since there could be many cases like someone may delete a drop down by selecting none so another drop downs list may have to be refreshed which could mess up an existing selection thats why when this was initially made we went the route of showing warnings when a user selects a & b together for example rather than making the drop down show only modifiers only action keys it sounds like it could be a lot of changes along with that i noticed that it would be good to have boxlist of comboboxitem s so we can attach key code as value in that way we can throw away indexes logic so we do not have to rely on the exact order in the two arrays key codes and key code names what do you think it will help if we want to keep different amount of keys in different orders for dropdowns should we implement it in this pull request or create separate issuethis sounds good but i think its better to create a separate issue for this to keep the scope of this pr smaller i think while the change to comboboxitems is made it could also be possible to do the not show disable in the drop down and similar for modifier action keys like it could be something like if there is only drop down you can choose any key and if there are more the non last dropdowns will have only modifier keys and the last one again allows you to choose any except disable since that is a separate case since a lot more features have been added in this code space recently like key to shortcut shortcut to key disable being added now etc i think there are some places for cleaning up the ui code like this one ui case where it is possible to select modifier disable ive mentioned in a separate comment the missing code there is one more place in the shortcutcontrol file where getkeycodelist has to be replaced with the new version for the first call it should have renderdisabled as false and for second it should be trueit is two more reasons to implement https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues does this implement jmahlerss pr from https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull or the two are related but independent it was built on top of it adding tests and implementing the shortcut disable feature as well along with some tweaks

over here https claopensourcemicrosoftcom microsoft powertoys and sign the cla x tests added passed info on pull request_what does this include_module changes the existing code for enabling disabling involves removing adding the registry key which is added during installation but it was set for hkcu reg instead of hklm in the installer it was changed to hklm in a later release because of this enabling disabling could add remove some unused registry entries this has been changed to hklm to avoid any errors in the future if the code is uncommented for thumbnail providers the registry modification steps were incorrect so they have been changed accordingly to read write hkcr fileextension {e fccd a b f e } with value as the clsid of the provider to allow the fileexplorerpreviewsettings code to be more usable for future modules fileexplorerpreviewsettings was made into an interface with most methods implemented except the registry related methods previewhandlersettings and thumbnailprovidersettings classes were added which implemented the above interfaces this separation was made since the registry paths and logic differed between the two with this change the two variables for storing the preview handlers and thumbnail providers in powerpreview were combined removed unnecessary arguments in registry wrapper a checkregistrystate method was added to the interface which is used to check if the registry key for enabling disabling that module is already present with the correct values or not updatestate method in the interface was modified such that it takes elevation state as argument after updating the toggle state and checking if the file explorer powertoy is enabled it checks if the registry state already matches the new state if it doesnt it makes the necessary update if pt is elevated or returns a failure if it is not elevated in set_config in powerpreview when a setting changes updatestate is called on all the modules and if any of them return a failure a warning message is shown to the user indicating the user would have to restart pt as admin for settings to take effect this code path would generally not occur in new settings it could occur in old settings though in powerpreview a wrapper was added which first checks if the registry state of all the modules matches the toggle state and if it doesnt it performs a method if elevation or shows the warning if not elevated the wrapper is used in enable so that modules which are enabled as per the toggle setting should be enabled in registry since enable gets called when pt is started if there is a mismatch between the settings if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules an elevation only check wrapper is also used in disable so that modules get disabled in registry only if elevated since disable gets called when pt is started if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules regarding the above points the enable disable setting is not exposed in new settings but it is in old settings this could cause issues if a user upgrades from old to new settings via windows update and previously disabled file explorer as they can never re enable itui changes the settings format for file explorer was invalid on c side and would get ignored by runner as it had properties instead of properties that has been fixed since the registry can be modified only if pt is run as admin additional text has been added to warn the user that the settings can be modified only if run as admin this is visible only if pt is unelevated when pt is unelevated the toggles and text for these settings are disabled an additional textblock has been added for thumbnail provider toggles to indicate a reboot might be required for changes to take effect for checking elevation the viewmodel has been modified to include the general settings as well as done in some other settings modules the iselevated value of the general settings config is used tests have been refactored accordingly to include the extra argument tests updated existing powerpreview setregistryvalue tests to check registryvalue as well split updatestate tests to include elevation status and previewhandler vs thumbnailprovider differences split enable disable tests for previewhandler and thumbnailprovider to check correct registry details feedback required text on the warning dialogs and the settings page unused enable setting for file explorer the enable value for file explorer in the general settings file was used in old settings as there was an external toggle and separate toggles for each handler but there is no toggle in new settings so there is no way to modify that value if a user was using old settings ie old windows version and had file explorer disabled when they move the new settings by windows update the setting will still be disabled but it cannot be changed from pt settings and the user has to manually modify the json should we deprecate that or add another toggle which results in all the handlers getting disabled the equivalent of the enable toggles for a powertoy as a whole modifying registry when running pt from vs and pt isnt installed could lead to bad registry this could affect devs validation steps performed_how does someone test & validate_ build and install msi before running pt validate that md svg preview handlers are working and svg thumbnails are working check your general settings json file and file explorer settings file based on the values you should see one of the scenarios similarly when powertoys isnt running you can modify the file to one of the scenarios below to check if the expected behavior occurs run powertoys elevated unelevated and check the corresponding row the expected behavior below assumes that all modules are enabled in the registry as would occur in a fresh install if file explorer is enabled in general settings for any other registry state basically if the json and registry states dont match in case of unelevated powertoys it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will make the changes as per json if file explorer is not enabled all of them will always be disabled file explorer in general settings file explorer settings svg ph svg tp md ph elevation behavior enabled all enabled false no warning and all work enabled all enabled true no warning and all work disabled any combination false warning and all work disabled any combination true no warning and all disabled enabled at least one disabled false warning and all work enabled at least one disabled true no warning and only the ones which are enabled will work im ok with disabling the current options but it would be better to add something to the page since it looks like there was a rendering problemcan we remove only the toggles and leave some text to list the current available extensions the other way that could be done is to modify the dopreview method https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob master src modules previewpane markdownpreviewhandler markdownpreviewhandlercsl such that the value in settingsjson file is checked and only then it is rendered this however doesnt actually disable the preview handler it just does a blank render instead of the actual previewi think this should be the preferred way of doing the disable enable feature htcfreek i think this should be the preferred way of doing the disable enable featureit would be a hack since if we tell the users that something is off it should be off and not just faking it htcfreek i think this should be the preferred way of doing the disable enable feature it would be a hack since if we tell the users that

justify to take shortcuts htcfreek we should offer what is consistent for the users most users dont run this in a multi user environment and we should offer a true option to turn the features off for multi user environment we dont have a good solution at present but doesnt justify to take shortcutsfor a while i found the registry key hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\shell extensions\blocked as far as i know the key also exist under hkcu could this registry key helps us arjunbalgovind based on the conversation yesterday i think we need to fix this so the registry gets updated properly via an elevated process and also we probably need to restart explorer crutkas should we prompt the user here ryanbodrug microsoft and also we probably need to restart explorerthat is something that will bite us we tried everything with the msi installer and the only reliable solution is to tell the user to log off on or restart windows im with enricogior here every time we try to restart the explorer for legit reasons people get mad i honestly dont think we need to as well since the installer doesnt im with enricogior here every time we try to restart the explorer for legit reasons people get mad i honestly dont think we need to as well since the installer doesntim okay with this as long as its clear to the user that they wont see the impact of the toggle until they restart their pc unless im mistaken on that also doesnt the exe prompt the user to opt in to restart explorer im with enricogior here every time we try to restart the explorer for legit reasons people get mad i honestly dont think we need to as well since the installer doesntwe should try to send the shchangenotify message while specifying the parameter shcne_assocchanged this should reload the registered associations and shell handlers see second paragraph on this page https docsmicrosoftcom en us windows win shell reg shell exts ryanbodrug microsoft also doesnt the exe prompt the user to opt in to restart explorernot anymore because it first uninstalls the previous version and then installs the new version instead of just upgrading itdoing so its enough to have the shell extension reloaded by explorerfor the on off option in the settings for the shell extensions if we unregister the extensions they should get turned off immediately same when they are turned on the problem with the msi upgrade was that upgrading the extensions was not guaranteeing the new version was immediately reloaded in memory by explorer but since here we are talking about turning on off the same binary it shouldnt be an issue enricogior as i understand we dont need the restart on enabling disabling the preview right arjunbalgovind enricogior is the enabling disable by register unregister the extension a system wide all users thingif yes i think we should have a hint on the settings page arjunbalgovind as i can see in your last commits you did the necessary changes in the settings pageshould we rename this pr or is it a good idea to create a new pr htcfreek as i understand we dont need the restart on enabling disabling the preview rightright is the enabling disable by register unregister the extension a system wide all users thingyes crutkas ryanbodrug microsoft ive mentioned some specifics which i would appreciate some feedback on in the pr description apart from the exact ui text its mainly related to consistency upgrade paths from old settings to new settings which could cause quirks which we should discuss more in detail arjunbalgovind for me the warning message failed to modify explorer modules makes no sense because it would only appear if the register unregister command is called without elevated pt settings but this could not happen when the buttons are disabled in non admin modedo we really need this message box arjunbalgovind for me the warning message failed to modify explorer modules makes no sense because it would only appear if the register unregister command is called without elevated pt settings but this could not happen when the buttons are disabled in non admin mode do we really need this message boxyes it is required because when users update to the version of pt with this fix their toggles could have been in any state some could be enabled some could be disabled but these settings were never actually used before so if they launch powertoys we would need to show this warning to let them know that they need to restart pt for those settings to be appliedthis is also required for the old powertoys settings for users on windows version or below because the toggles can be modified there azp run azure pipelines successfully started running

microsoft what do you think why we know the destination of the lnk file full path so we can check if we have an application where the end of the full path matching the search string fullpath match firefoxexe$ im with htcfreek on this we should do something with the target of lnk files because this will work for every lnk that we than will support and when you link to something that it would be processed in its way htcfreek on a second thought i agree that the approach you mentioned would be a cleaner way to do it we should keep in mind a lnk can also point to a different exe with program arguments preconfigured for example for pinned sites in edge chrome youtube for example in that case the location is edge but has specific arguments to launch it with youtube open in a special window we should keep in mind a lnk can also point to a different exe with program arguments preconfigured for example for pinned sites in edge chrome youtube for example in that case the location is edge but has specific arguments to launch it with youtube open in a special window here the exe is named for example edge_proxyexe for edge so we definitely dont get the webapp as result if someone types edgeexe but it could be interesting if someone tries to start edge_proxyexe with parametersmaybe we need an blacklist or we dont allow to start webapp with additional parameters or we allow to add additional parameters to the existing in lnk file parameters what could lead to confusion should we for now we can use this enhancement and make the parsing of the an separate issue or should this be a full rewrite to encompass this following of the target with some logic of additional parameters

conversation fel free to open a issue were you describe it and or a pr cmyk is specific to a device possibly calibrated to a working color space and therefore requires associated color profiles css color https draftscsswgorg css color device cmyk hence has no generic cmyk notation and calls the fallback conversion algorithm that is also used herein “naive” it is really just yet another notation for colors in the additive srgb color space and not in any subtractive space that offers no advantage over existing notations who would use these naive cmyk values anyway and what for they only give a false glimpse of hope of being more appropriate for printing than srgb values but without calibration and profiles they are really not so does photoshop remove this until you calibrate hello the cmyk is the native cmyk and use this calculationhttps wwww org tr css color naively convert from rgba to cmyk black max red green blue cyan red black black or if black is magenta green black black or if black is yellow blue black black or if black is we can add the word uncalibrated to the cmyk entry to make it more clearwhen you work with cymk values how do you know that a cmyk value is a calibrated value or not hello the cmyk is the native cmyk and use this calculationone letter can make a difference native versus naïve i don’t know what adobe does in photoshop their users who chose to work with cmyk files hopefully know what they are doing the questions you need to ask are these who would need those pseudo cmyk values nobody who would use those pseudo cmyk values people who dont know what they are doing and who are expecting them to be something else the algorithm is specified in css for fallback cases that can happen therein this does not apply for a color picker

hopefull it wont be blocked by a new merge conflict ryanbodrug microsoft you can test it now hopefully it wont be blocked by a new merge conflictthanks p storm looking now sorry i know this is a pain but much appreciated 🥇 ryanbodrug microsoft you can test it now hopefully it wont be blocked by a new merge conflict thanks p storm looking now sorry i know this is a pain but much appreciated 🥇 ryanbodrug microsoft and again this time git was stupid usings problems lets try it again it looks good to me a couple really small things ive verified kbm mapping keys shortcuts as well as dynamically adding and removing win and packaged apps as well as updating settings files ill defer to enricogior for final approval as his team will be on the hook for maintaining these files after this monthand did fixed those small things this should be completely ready we want to lock this friday due to size we feel we should get this in as soon as we snap to stable this gives everyone a month to verify all the code path updates here ugh more merge requests can someone look again to my pull request and merge when i have it mergable again i think is out so this could be closed than we can do this now enricogior let me know if you want me to approve this this may conflict with some work on invest so i would like to get this in as soon as possible but i dont want to make the call on behalf of your team lets get this pr updated to resolve the conflicts and then we can do the final review and merge enricogior i have fixed the merge request again i see that there could be some work in tests that are using iioprovidermocks but that will be something for another pr iioprovidermocks is not using the mocked file system but it uses the interfaces this should be also using the mocked filesystem p storm thanksthere is one very important thing that we forgot to verify do you know if systemioabstractions is fully supported tested on arm p storm thanks there is one very important thing that we forgot to verify do you know if systemioabstractions is fully supported tested on armthat is a great question that i do not know the answer or know how it could be tested i know that it is a wrapper around the normal systemio validating but pretty sure since it is net standard this should be ok since this library would be functional with a uwp app which by default supports arm p storm today we do the final review of your pr and then merge itas you can see there new conflicts lets plan a final conflict resolution and then merge it right after they are resolved to avoid more conflicts for the review thanks yuyoyuppe for looking into it as explained i didnt introduce the changes so im hesistant to introduce those in my pr if we want to change this and maybe other things in these areas i would suggest a loose pr for itfor the conflicting files i will do this right after my work in about hour and push it again will mention you again enricogior than so we can merge it fast to master and not have another merge request p storm sure since those changes werent introduced by you ive resolved the comments for now well do them as a separate prs later enricogior i have merged it p storm greatwaiting for ci to complete and ill merge it

imagesgithubusercontentcom d b b eb aa e b f ff png good comments we need another go to check on accessibility inc colors niels martinchrzan omg its amazing great work one point i want to be mentioned the contrast between the copycolor button and the ui background could be higherfor clarification my comment is regarding to the moment when you hover and press the button the the color button and the background is nearly the same what you can see in your own screenshot and another suggestion you have this wide button for adding color representations where the people mostly will click in the middle where you have the plus sign and then opens a small menu on the right side and you have to move the cursor over the half ui this is not the best usability and looks a bit like not fully thought it but i think you have thought much about the way you could do this ui not sure if this is a good solution in way of accessibility possible solution the menu should have the same wide as the button and centered text or it opens at the cursor position htcfreek lets review final ui once this goes out of draft theres still work to be done and we are aware htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes so these should be fine for contrast i have updated the images in the pr description htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes

label issue under applies todone martinchrzan niels is it ready for the final review not yet i need to fix some functionality fix installer add telemetry but design wise it should be almost done martinchrzan i have an idea which maybee needs a bit work to realise should i mention it now or should i wait until the pr is ready for review htcfreek go on now idea regarding the open activation behaviour i think at the moment its not clear that i can either copy color code or open editor while only looking in settings so i would change the settings a bit variant change only the text to open editor instead of copy color code on activation shortcut variant my 👍 if we only change settings representation because this is a setting with switching behaviour i would use radios instead of a checkbox then the settings are easier to so the settings then will be like this action on activation shortcut copy color code open editor variant my 👍 additional i would appreciate it to pick a color and directly open show it in editor and if we allow this we should use radios and we maybe need an additional shortcut button to only open the editorso the settings then will be like this action on color picker shortcut copy color code open editor pick color and show it in editorshortcut button for only open editor only available if radio two is checked thoughts about color format settings copied color settings mention that this is for copy code mode list for individual formats we should clearly mention that this setting is used in editor we should make the header better readable by using two lines or brackets both enable settings elements based on the activation mode copy code editor htcfreek i agree with most suggestions we will reword it better and make it more clear what is it expected to happen on activation shortcut martinchrzan in the color fine tune ui wevhave now three sliders what is the difference between slider two and three the look nearly like the same and maybee we can describe its value type in a tooltip htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for them htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for thembut i would use the names h ue s aturation and b rightness one thing we should consider is if it makes sense to have a theme override settings in color picker too feedback first this is really slick i think the first

the old behaviour can be restored in settings with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editor good question two shortcuts could be a way one to color pick and one for the editor but sounds a bit overcomplex to me open in settings or use the snip and sketch way standalone app launch or a

recommendations it shows color history but also let you tweak the color and copy color formatsmy idea would be something like color preview & history settings ordering i think we may need to think

in our own way until the new winui listview is available with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editor crutkas niels in my comment above i suggest a radio button control but drop down sounds good tooimo we should definitely improve the text to make clear that this setting changes the behaviour from open picker only to open editor only niels i see great value in the picker however i strongly believe if i do the keystroke it is since i wanted to sample a color you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have either another activation shortcut or if we open editor after you pick a color you would have to pick some dummy color just to open the editor and see your color history you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have either another activation shortcut or if we open editor after you pick a color you would have to pick some dummy color just to open the editor and see your color historywhat about using tray menu of pt to open only editor this would be something for the ui in two buttons the first for picking and copy or editor the second for opening directly only the editor you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have

pt to open only editor this would be something for the ui in two buttons the first for picking and copy or editor the second for opening directly only the editor currently win shift c opens the colour picker and then you have to left click on the mouse or trackpad to get the colour what if you could right click to open the editor wouldn´t be the more natural behaviour or at least the expected onejust a humble suggestion from a userbtw you guys rock niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format name niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format namefeels cramped i would like to keep the text aligned with all other ui elements the rest of the items appear to be correct so if you have perl you can run the command given by the bot or you can just manually add the items listed into github actions spell check expecttxt oddly there are two different live prs that will be trying to add modernwpf so if you both sort alphabetically one will hit a merge conflict youd be better served randomly inserting it and letting someone else sort&uniquify later martinchrzan should we rename the copied colorformat to something like default color format we can but we wanted to indicate that it will be also copied not just shown or would that be implied or something like default displayed and copied color format or too long too weird 🙂 updated the activation key trigger action options from one checkbox to following options image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom fa eb e f fea ab dpng updated the activation

to clipboard open editor and copy a color open color picker and show editor after copythis focuses on actions i mean that text like browse your history or pick a new color is more like a comment the text in the previously shown image uses a comma in the first radio and dashes in the others and thats just weird inconsistent and unnecessary if these comments are still worth mentioning give them a

brand if so always uppercase is it not if so use sentence caps also why is hex all caps individual color formats can be shown or hidden in the list below is odd id suggest show additional color

imagesgithubusercontentcom c b eb dd e c f bpng i also strongly believe the default should be color then editor is the changes for all of the above crutkas personal preference would be to start small when ordering the text actions in the radio buttons for example i would start with the simple current color picker on top but again personal individual color formats can be shown or hidden in the list below but _the list below_ isnt the target the list in the editor is so i would say something like select color formats to show in the editor toggle switches are widely used in windows settings nowadays but i believe that in this case check boxes should be used because changing one of the check boxes does not directly start a new action or change something the changes will only be visible in a different gui that cant be used at the same time as when youre changing settings for a binary choice the main difference between a check box and a toggle switch is that the check box is for status and the toggle switch is for action you can delay committing a check box interaction as part of a form submit for example while you should immediately commit a toggle switch interaction also only check boxes allow for multi selectionhttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns checkbox choosing between toggle switch and check box for some actions either a toggle switch or a check box might work to decide which control would work better follow these tips use a toggle switch for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them use check boxes for optional nice to have items use a checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective for example if the user must click a submit or next button to apply changes use a check box use check boxes when the user can select multiple items that are related to a single setting or featurehttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns toggles the example of the list of languages in jsorefs comment gives me a new idea we could use the format on the top of the list to automatically be the one that will be copied it would remove need for the dropdown combo list open question what color would make sense to use in the examples of the different formats maybe the current system accent color can be used in all the examples crutkas niels martinchrzan think about if we want to merge the working cp and do the text settings improvements in a new pr after discussing them in a new issue this pr here gets a bit big and imo we discuss without comming to a final solution which is implemented in the next daysand i dont have an overview on how the settings page is look like yet and what different improvements are suggested absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checked absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checkedwe need to pay attention on merging first and we have to fix the build errors before merging martinchrzan later maybe we can collect the suggestions made mok ups and then create a closed survey where we can only vote but not commentfor me this sounds like a good way to get a decision sorry i just saw clint asking for thoughts i got plenty of those and i like sharing them 🤷🏻‍♂️but im happy to copy n paste them into a new issue pr later if that would be better i think we need to be hyper focused on issues at hand versus larger issues at this point i feel weve move past toggle vs checkbox for this prlets merge this puppy in and address targeted adjustments in a new issue martinchrzan we did some testing and we didnt run into any issue 👍i have some feedback for the ux i didnt read all the comments in the pr so sorry if these have been already suggested sorted out the editor opens in the same place where it was last used it would be nice to have an option to make it open where the cursor is is not immediately clear that in the

onejust a humble suggestion from a userbtw you guys rock niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format name niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format namefeels cramped i would like to keep the text aligned with all other ui elements the rest of the items appear to be correct so if you have perl you can run the command given by the bot or you can just manually add the items listed into github actions spell check expecttxt oddly there are two different live prs that will be trying to add modernwpf so if you both sort alphabetically one will hit a merge conflict youd be better served randomly inserting it and letting someone else sort&uniquify later martinchrzan should we rename the copied colorformat to something like default color format we can but we wanted to indicate that it will be also copied not just shown or would that be implied or something like default displayed and copied color format or too long too weird 🙂 updated the activation key trigger action options from one checkbox to following options image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom fa eb e f fea ab dpng updated the activation

to clipboard open editor and copy a color open color picker and show editor after copythis focuses on actions i mean that text like browse your history or pick a new color is more like a comment the text in the previously shown image uses a comma in the first radio and dashes in the others and thats just weird inconsistent and unnecessary if these comments are still worth mentioning give them a

the pt module color picker and one of the features is the color pickeractually photoshop and powerpoint are using the term eyedropper for the picking colors bit maybe thats a better term and will also avoid any confusion cc martinchrzan thoughts image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d d eb cf dd f dbpng hm not sure i like eyedropper we are not dropping any eyes but picking a color with it

formats shown in editor description between header and table text in light grey the color formats can be shown or hidden btw i would not write individual because the user cant create own formats example header _description_ table row niels martinchrzan in the pr description you add a gif showing the new picking ui experience in this gif the color code ui is behind the zoom ui i think this should be changed to be the other way zoom window is behind the color code ui htcfreek you can ignore that it is only debug issue we didnt change that behavior i cant compile this locally due to vs can we sync this with the main branch i did a few tweaks on text and layout thoughts image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c b eb dd e c f bpng i also strongly believe the default should be color then editor https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull is the changes for all of the above id argue that that open color picker s case differs from open color picker with is problematic is it a brand if so always uppercase is it not if so use sentence caps also why is hex all caps individual color formats can be shown or hidden in the list below is odd id suggest show additional color formats wrt change the order of appearance by dragging windows press and hold or select then drag to rearrange them https wwwthewindowsclubcom wp content uploads how to change language in windows x

imagesgithubusercontentcom c b eb dd e c f bpng i also strongly believe the default should be color then editor is the changes for all of the above crutkas personal preference would be to start small when ordering the text actions in the radio buttons for example i would start with the simple current color picker on top but again personal individual color formats can be shown or hidden in the list below but _the list below_ isnt the target the list in the editor is so i would say something like select color formats to show in the editor toggle switches are widely used in windows settings nowadays but i believe that in this case check boxes should be used because changing one of the check boxes does not directly start a new action or change something the changes will only be visible in a different gui that cant be used at the same time as when youre changing settings for a binary choice the main difference between a check box and a toggle switch is that the check box is for status and the toggle switch is for action you can delay committing a check box interaction as part of a form submit for example while you should immediately commit a toggle switch interaction also only check boxes allow for multi selectionhttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns checkbox choosing between toggle switch and check box for some actions either a toggle switch or a check box might work to decide which control would work better follow these tips use a toggle switch for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them use check boxes for optional nice to have items use a checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective for example if the user must click a submit or next button to apply changes use a check box use check boxes when the user can select multiple items that are related to a single setting or featurehttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns toggles the example of the list of languages in jsorefs comment gives me a new idea we could use the format on the top of the list to automatically be the one that will be copied it would remove need for the dropdown combo list open question what color would make sense to use in the examples of the different formats maybe the current system accent color can be used in all the examples crutkas niels martinchrzan think about if we want to merge the working cp and do the text settings improvements in a new pr after discussing them in a new issue this pr here gets a bit big and imo we discuss without comming to a final solution which is implemented in the next daysand i dont have an overview on how the settings page is look like yet and what different improvements are suggested absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checked absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checkedwe need to pay attention on merging first and we have to fix the build errors before merging martinchrzan later maybe we can collect the suggestions made mok ups and then create a closed survey where we can only vote but not commentfor me this sounds like a good way to get a decision sorry i just saw clint asking for thoughts i got plenty of those and i like sharing them 🤷🏻‍♂️but im happy to copy n paste them into a new issue pr later if that would be better i think we need to be hyper focused on issues at hand versus larger issues at this point i feel weve move past toggle vs checkbox for this prlets merge this puppy in and address targeted adjustments in a new issue martinchrzan we did some testing and we didnt run into any issue 👍i have some feedback for the ux i didnt read all the comments in the pr so sorry if these have been already suggested sorted out the editor opens in the same place where it was last used it would be nice to have an option to make it open where the cursor is is not immediately clear that in the editor is possible to choose a similar color or adjust the current color have you considered to add a label on top of the color bar what about adding to the right click menu an option to remove all the colors image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a eb a eb aef c ede b png enricogior right know it should open in the center of the screen we could open it where you picked it i just wonder if

same place it was before or move to a new location or do you want to have as an option in the settings niels any opinions on this one agree it is not immediately clear that you can do something with the color bar niels what about enricos suggestion for some label would it be cluttering the ui sure we can add that niels should we use the same icon as for remove enricogior right know it should open

this colorpicker photoshop https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d a eb e f ef c dbegif id go for a clear all button at the bottom of the vertical list or have keyboard support to multi select colors

feedback niels should we change the cursor to hand or something else when over colorpickercontrolor or would it be confusing since we dont change it on other buttons image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom b edf a eb adf f d apng yeah lets leave it out for now and ship it to see if we run into any major issues we could add eg a teaching tip at some point as an oobe for the

moving on a screen martinchrzan did you notice picker being slower when moving on a screenno but i tested on a desktop with a core cpu and a dedicated gpu partying_face tada shipit martinchrzan yeah if it lags lets get it out i dont think wpf shadows are as optimized as the uwp themeshadows do we get this in for martinchrzan this will need https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull s fix which is

when ordering the text actions in the radio buttons for example i would start with the simple current color picker on top but again personal individual color formats can be shown or hidden in the list below but _the list below_ isnt the target the list in the editor is so i would say something like select color formats to show in the editor toggle switches are widely used in windows settings nowadays but i believe that in this case check boxes should be used because changing one of the check boxes does not directly start a new action or change something the changes will only be visible in a different gui that cant be used at the same time as when youre changing settings for a binary choice the main difference between a check box and a toggle switch is that the check box is for status and the toggle switch is for action you can delay committing a check box interaction as part of a form submit for example while you should immediately commit a toggle switch interaction also only check boxes allow for multi selectionhttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns checkbox choosing between toggle switch and check box for some actions either a toggle switch or a check box might work to decide which control would work better follow these tips use a toggle switch for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them use check boxes for optional nice to have items use a checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective for example if the user must click a submit or next button to apply changes use a check box use check boxes when the user can select multiple items that are related to a single setting or featurehttps docsmicrosoftcom en us windows uwp design controls and patterns toggles the example of the list of languages in jsorefs comment gives me a new idea we could use the format on the top of the list to automatically be the one that will be copied it would remove need for the dropdown combo list open question what color would make sense to use in the examples of the different formats maybe the current system accent color can be used in all the examples crutkas niels martinchrzan think about if we want to merge the working cp and do the text settings improvements in a new pr after discussing them in a new issue this pr here gets a bit big and imo we discuss without comming to a final solution which is implemented in the next daysand i dont have an overview on how the settings page is look like yet and what different improvements are suggested absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checked absolutely we have more than lines added yet we discuss sentences in settings which i consider the least important in here i would like to get the code and functionality checkedwe need to pay attention on merging first and we have to fix the build errors before merging martinchrzan later maybe we can collect the suggestions made mok ups and then create a closed survey where we can only vote but not commentfor me this sounds like a good way to get a decision sorry i just saw clint asking for thoughts i got plenty of those and i like sharing them 🤷🏻‍♂️but im happy to copy n paste them into a new issue pr later if that would be better i think we need to be hyper focused on issues at hand versus larger issues at this point i feel weve move past toggle vs checkbox for this prlets merge this puppy in and address targeted adjustments in a new issue martinchrzan we did some testing and we didnt run into any issue 👍i have some feedback for the ux i didnt read all the comments in the pr so sorry if these have been already suggested sorted out the editor opens in the same place where it was last used it would be nice to have an option to make it open where the cursor is is not immediately clear that in the editor is possible to choose a similar color or adjust the current color have you considered to add a label on top of the color bar what about adding to the right click menu an option to remove all the colors image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a eb a eb aef c ede b png enricogior right know it should open in the center of the screen we could open it where you picked it i just wonder if

same place it was before or move to a new location or do you want to have as an option in the settings niels any opinions on this one agree it is not immediately clear that you can do something with the color bar niels what about enricos suggestion for some label would it be cluttering the ui sure we can add that niels should we use the same icon as for remove enricogior right know it should open

this colorpicker photoshop https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d a eb e f ef c dbegif id go for a clear all button at the bottom of the vertical list or have keyboard support to multi select colors eg holding shift right clicking delete would then remove all colors adding keyboard support multi select might be more work i can imagine martinchrzan niels lets ship it and lets see the community feedback niels should we change the cursor to hand or something else when over colorpickercontrolor or would it be confusing since we dont change it on other buttons image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom b edf a eb adf f d apng yeah lets leave it out for now and ship it to see if we run into any major issues we could add eg a teaching tip at some point as an oobe for the

moving on a screen martinchrzan did you notice picker being slower when moving on a screenno but i tested on a desktop with a core cpu and a dedicated gpu partying_face tada shipit martinchrzan yeah if it lags lets get it out i dont think wpf shadows are as optimized as the uwp themeshadows do we get this in for martinchrzan this will need https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull s fix which is

someone test & validate_ niels martinchrzan omg its amazing great workone point i want to be mentioned the contrast between the copycolor button and the ui background could be higher great workjoining htcfreek in asking if this elements have enough test to background contrast since we already have some accessibility bugs opened because of similar low contrast values image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d b b eb aa e b f ff png good comments we need another go to check on accessibility inc colors niels martinchrzan omg its amazing great work one point i want to be mentioned the contrast between the copycolor button and the ui background could be higherfor clarification my comment is regarding to the moment when you hover and press the button the the color button and the background is nearly the same what you can see in your own screenshot and another suggestion you have this wide button for adding color representations where the people mostly will click in the middle where you have the plus sign and then opens a small menu on the right side and you have to move the cursor over the half ui this is not the best usability and looks a bit like not fully thought it but i think you have thought much about the way you could do this ui not sure if this is a good solution in way of accessibility possible solution the menu should have the same wide as the button and centered text or it opens at the cursor position htcfreek lets review final ui once this goes out of draft theres still work to be done and we are aware htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes so these should be fine for contrast i have updated the images in the pr description htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes

label issue under applies todone martinchrzan niels is it ready for the final review not yet i need to fix some functionality fix installer add telemetry but design wise it should be almost done martinchrzan i have an idea which maybee needs a bit work to realise should i mention it now or should i wait until the pr is ready for review htcfreek go on now idea regarding the open activation behaviour i think at the moment its not clear that i can either copy color code or open editor while only looking in settings so i would change the settings a bit variant change only the text to open editor instead of copy color code on activation shortcut variant my 👍 if we only change settings representation because this is a setting with switching behaviour i would use radios instead of a checkbox then the settings are easier to so the settings then will be like this action on activation shortcut copy color code open editor variant my 👍 additional i would appreciate it to pick a color and directly open show it in editor and if we allow this we should use radios and we maybe need an additional shortcut button to only open the editorso the settings then will be like this action on color picker shortcut copy color code open editor pick color and show it in editorshortcut button for only open editor only available if radio two is checked thoughts about color format settings copied color settings mention that this is for copy code mode list for individual formats we should clearly mention that this setting is used in editor we should make the header better readable by using two lines or brackets both enable settings elements based on the activation mode copy code editor htcfreek i agree with most suggestions we will reword it better and make it more clear what is it expected to happen on activation shortcut martinchrzan in the color fine tune ui wevhave now three sliders what is the difference between slider two and three the look nearly like the same and maybee we can describe its value type in a tooltip htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for them htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for thembut i would use the names h ue s aturation and b rightness one thing we should consider is if it makes sense to have a theme override settings in color picker too feedback first this is really slick i think the first three issues we should have a discussion on so interaction model i feel like we have a change of default behavior imo this should be false by default to open editor important image https user

should be false by default to open editor important i think the editor actually changes the value prop of what color picker is its superior in the sense that youll get access to more color formats and a color history im afraid that turning it off by default most users will never get to see it at all with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior

i think the editor actually changes the value prop of what color picker is its superior in the sense that youll get access to more color formats and a color history im afraid that turning it off by

the old behaviour can be restored in settings with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editor good question two shortcuts could be a way one to color pick and one for the editor but sounds a bit overcomplex to me open in settings or use the snip and sketch way standalone app launch or a

someone test & validate_ niels martinchrzan omg its amazing great workone point i want to be mentioned the contrast between the copycolor button and the ui background could be higher great workjoining htcfreek in asking if this elements have enough test to background contrast since we already have some accessibility bugs opened because of similar low contrast values image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom d b b eb aa e b f ff png good comments we need another go to check on accessibility inc colors niels martinchrzan omg its amazing great work one point i want to be mentioned the contrast between the copycolor button and the ui background could be higherfor clarification my comment is regarding to the moment when you hover and press the button the the color button and the background is nearly the same what you can see in your own screenshot and another suggestion you have this wide button for adding color representations where the people mostly will click in the middle where you have the plus sign and then opens a small menu on the right side and you have to move the cursor over the half ui this is not the best usability and looks a bit like not fully thought it but i think you have thought much about the way you could do this ui not sure if this is a good solution in way of accessibility possible solution the menu should have the same wide as the button and centered text or it opens at the cursor position htcfreek lets review final ui once this goes out of draft theres still work to be done and we are aware htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes so these should be fine for contrast i have updated the images in the pr description htcfreek enricogior we have made updates to the ui using windows x color palettes so these should be fine for contrast i have updated the images in the pr descriptionlgtmcan you please post a screenshot of settings too btw please reference the shortcut settings label issue under

label issue under applies todone martinchrzan niels is it ready for the final review not yet i need to fix some functionality fix installer add telemetry but design wise it should be almost done martinchrzan i have an idea which maybee needs a bit work to realise should i mention it now or should i wait until the pr is ready for review htcfreek go on now idea regarding the open activation behaviour i think at the moment its not clear that i can either copy color code or open editor while only looking in settings so i would change the settings a bit variant change only the text to open editor instead of copy color code on activation shortcut variant my 👍 if we only change settings representation because this is a setting with switching behaviour i would use radios instead of a checkbox then the settings are easier to so the settings then will be like this action on activation shortcut copy color code open editor variant my 👍 additional i would appreciate it to pick a color and directly open show it in editor and if we allow this we should use radios and we maybe need an additional shortcut button to only open the editorso the settings then will be like this action on color picker shortcut copy color code open editor pick color and show it in editorshortcut button for only open editor only available if radio two is checked thoughts about color format settings copied color settings mention that this is for copy code mode list for individual formats we should clearly mention that this setting is used in editor we should make the header better readable by using two lines or brackets both enable settings elements based on the activation mode copy code editor htcfreek i agree with most suggestions we will reword it better and make it more clear what is it expected to happen on activation shortcut martinchrzan in the color fine tune ui wevhave now three sliders what is the difference between slider two and three the look nearly like the same and maybee we can describe its value type in a tooltip htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for them htcfreek they represent hsv the first being hue the second is saturation and the third is value they affect each others we can probably add some tooltip for thembut i would use the names h ue s aturation and b rightness one thing we should consider is if it makes sense to have a theme override settings in color picker too feedback first this is really slick i think the first three issues we should have a discussion on so interaction model i feel like we have a change of default behavior imo this should be false by default to open editor important image https user

should be false by default to open editor important i think the editor actually changes the value prop of what color picker is its superior in the sense that youll get access to more color formats and a color history im afraid that turning it off by default most users will never get to see it at all with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editorgood question two shortcuts could be a way one to color pick and one for the editor but sounds a bit overcomplex to me open in settings or use the snip and sketch way standalone app launch or a notification banner after snipping i dont know if editor is the best phrasing here for the color history window important fair point any recommendations it shows color history but also let you tweak the color and copy color formats settings ordering i think we may need to think about how we show it is draggable right now i dont think

i think the editor actually changes the value prop of what color picker is its superior in the sense that youll get access to more color formats and a color history im afraid that turning it off by default most users will never get to see it at allhere i think you are right we should have editor as default to hint the user to the new feature maybe we can show a hint on first open of editor that the old behaviour can be restored in settings with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editor good question two shortcuts could be a way one to color pick and one for the editor but sounds a bit overcomplex to me open in settings or use the snip and sketch way standalone app launch or a notification banner after snipping here i reference to my post above where i wrote my ideas i dont know if editor is the best phrasing here for the color history window important fair point any recommendations it shows color history but also let you tweak the color and copy color formatsmy idea would be something like color preview & history settings ordering i think we may need to think about how we show it is draggable right now i dont think it is visually discoverable id show a drag glyph on mouse over good example is sharepoint sharepoint drag drop https user imagesgithubusercontentcom ca eb a fdea aa d gif this would be a great enhancement there should be a ghost image for dragging shouldnt that come with the default winui listview can we implement this in our own way until the new winui listview is available with the option off how do you open the editor important maybe this is a combo box for behavior dropper only open editor first dropper then open editor crutkas niels in my comment above i suggest a radio button control but drop down sounds good tooimo we should definitely improve the text to make clear that this setting changes the behaviour from open picker only to open editor only niels i see great value in the picker however i strongly believe if i do the keystroke it is since i wanted to sample a color you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have either another activation shortcut or if we open editor after you pick a color you would have to pick some dummy color just to open the editor and see your color history you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have either another activation shortcut or if we open editor after you pick a color you would have to pick some dummy color just to open the editor and see your color historywhat about using tray menu of pt to open only editor this would be something for the ui in two buttons the first for picking and copy or editor the second for opening directly only the editor you can still do it pressing a button in the left top corner in the editor opens picker so it would be one step more but not that bad other times you might want to get one of colors you picked before so you would have to have either another activation shortcut or if we open editor after you pick a color you would have to pick some dummy color just to open the editor and see your color history what about using tray menu of pt to open only editor this would be something for the ui in two buttons the first for picking and copy or editor the second for opening directly only the editor currently win shift c opens the colour picker and then you have to left click on the mouse or trackpad to get the colour what if you could right click to open the editor wouldn´t be the more natural behaviour or at least the expected onejust a humble suggestion from a userbtw you guys rock niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format name niels is it possible to move the gripper icon on the left side in front of the format namefeels cramped i would like to keep the text aligned with all other ui elements the rest of the items appear to be correct so if you have perl you can run the command given by the bot or you can just manually add the items listed into github actions spell check expecttxt oddly there are two different live prs that will be trying to add modernwpf so if you both sort alphabetically one will hit a merge conflict youd be better served randomly inserting it and letting someone else sort&uniquify later martinchrzan should we rename the copied colorformat to something like default color format we can but we wanted to indicate that it will be also copied not just shown or would that be implied or something like default displayed and copied color format or too long too weird 🙂 updated the activation key trigger action options from one checkbox to following options image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom fa eb e f fea ab dpng updated the activation

to clipboard open editor and copy a color open color picker and show editor after copythis focuses on actions i mean that text like browse your history or pick a new color is more like a comment the

stackpanel as it is hard to accomplish with the grid i tried to make minimum changes to accomplish it it seems like we can do a better job with ui part it is important to achieve encapsulation of components it feels unnatural when keydropdowncontrol functions have grid as a parameter but it is not a priority now as that part will be migrated to xaml pr checklist x applies to x cla signed if

checked im ready to accept this work might be rejected in favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place xxx info on pull request_what does this include_ layout was changed from grid to stackpanel grid and stackpanel parameters were replaced to rowindex in some functions because it simplifies things banded rows are accomplished manually that means if the number of rows changes the background of rows should be updated arrow column width is hardcoded now before it was calculated as table width minus width of other columns other columns and table widths were hardcoded so it does not make the difference_how does someone test & validate_ test all functionality of remap keys and remap shortcuts windows test the same windows with narrator on image https user

dark what brush es are being used hmm the brush i was going to recommend what you are using is that lets go with this as is and adjust later i would love if this was pulled into a style so we can tweak that versus code behind personally i would love if this was pulled into a style so we can tweak that versus code behind personallyi guess you are saying create our own brush name it differently from system one we do not have xaml file where we can put that brush because a thread that creates these windows runs inside of the runner process i think it would be easier to accomplish after migrating to xaml with the current implementation we can create a resource file and load it after the window is created should we try to implement that mykhailopylyp with the current implementation we can create a resource file and load it after the window is created should we try to implement thatit doesnt seem like we really need now given we will update this to winui the row names spoken by narrator are not correct after deleting a row also i managed to crash the shortcut editor these are the repro steps starting from no shortcuts create four rows delete the th row and then the st row select one of the combo boxes in the rd row and then move focus away from it this could really be two aspects of the same problem other than this kbm works ivan sic good catch the problem was that callbacks capture row id as integer so after deleting a row indexes shifts and it crashes because of out of boundary exception so i reverted that part back still similar crash starting from no shortcuts create four rows delete the th row and then the st rowwhen pressing the delete button on the st row you get a crash new misspellings found please review ignorcase to accept these changes run

to dive in to the use case for when youd do that style scaling in a tool like this versus a pro tool i agree with jay o way we should roll back this change because it removes a functionality that was

are refering to the dialog offset bug in editor for what its worth they fixed the bug in modernwpf in a matter of days after i reported it so atleast they are quick to respond but agree if it brings instability or performance issues we need to consider another solution we should be unified across the board on dlls two projects shouldnt be referencing different dll versions enricogior im holding

the following expression was not evaluated image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom eb a eb b dfff png expressions with dot decimal separator still works image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom cd af a eb d f fdcpng furthermore it seems as megas only interprets dot as decimal point separator i am afraid it is not easy to achieve this with megas one can try to replace coma to dot depending on currentculture also after that change inputvalid returns true for strings like and engineinterpret throw an exception as it does not recognize coma i added a converter that replaces all commas with dots when the currentuiculture is de is it working now martinchrzan im sorry i thought this was only specific to germany thanks for pointing this out martinchrzan i dont know if splitting input by spaces is such a good idea because then one would need to look at many edge cases like with no spaces and also seperate these since commas are not used for n ary functions but only as number seperators here i would suggest inputreplace cultureinfonumberformatnumberdecimalseparator there is also a class called numbertranslator which seems to be doing exactly that with translate method but it is not used please investigate that one instead of adding another code which does the same does this affect the thousands separator i think in the current version of powertoys the thousands seperator is not working when translator is not null it removes the thousands seperator and then it should work properly if the language of your windows is english the translator is null and doesnt translate at all and then it wont work i think in the current version of powertoys the thousands seperator is not working when translator is not null it removes the thousands seperator and then it

cultureinfocurrentculturenumberformatnumbergroupseparator thats the reason because there is currentuiculture and currentculture currentculture stores those format specific things as already mentioned here https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull discussion_r pavelzw so if you parse the string being entered do a check for the non number characters you come across then discard the one which matches the numbergroupseparator and then treat the one matching the numberdecimalseparator and handle the decimal digits etc mdtauk yes thats exactly what numbertranslatortranslate is doing pavelzw this is

enricogior thanks for the info i just checked your input on my computer the translator translates it correctly to from what ive seen calculatehelperinputvalid returns false for that makes sense because mages throws exceptions for these types of input my guess why works is that a preprocessor removes the before it gets send to mainquery and is not recognized by this preprocessor is this correctcan you check if works pavelzw can you check if worksit doesnt work image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c b d eb b a b dpng pavelzw btw after resetting the delimiter to the default values for the us culture the dot as decimal separator works as expected but the comma as thousands separator doesntdoes it work for you i worry the cases are too small were testing only en us and de deit does not matter what is the locale at all as far as i know there are only two ways how define a floating point comma or point en and de are just representatives of those approaches adding more locales will not bring any new information what we should do instead is to check against current defenition of a floating point as you can define a custom one however to test that we would need to use an interface for getting a current format from net api so it can be swapped in unit test by a normal dependency injection in the class where the logic is enricogior im good with this if you are pavelzw we have moved the calculator to src\modules\launcher\plugins\microsoftpowertoysrunplugincalculator you can try rebasing but it might be faster to just open a new pr enricogior let get this in even if it doesnt support manual change to the decimal separator its a niche case and we can always try to fix it alter onis it working when changing the locale completely on your system i didnt achieve to build powertoys on my computer some dlls are not found i only tested my changes we have moved the calculator to src\modules\launcher\plugins\microsoftpowertoysrunplugincalculator you can try rebasing but it might be faster to just open a new prill try to rebase it later pavelzw is it working when changing the locale completely on your system yes it does martinchrzan what we should do instead is to check against current defenition of a floating point as you can define a custom one however to test that we would need to use an interface for getting a current format from net api so it can be swapped in unit test by a normal dependency injection in the class where the logic is isnt that a bit overkill we would need to add one extra interface and an adapter from cultureinfo to this interface for this from my understanding wouldnt it be easier to just instantiate a new cultureinfo in the tests like this and use it for the instantiation of numbertranslator cultureinfo cultureinfo new cultureinfo en us { numberformat { numberdecimalseparator numbergroupseparator }} depending on what we want to test but your suggestion is enough new misspellings found please review seperator to

prefer if we would take this approach https blogsu ube lander post creating a pdf viewer in wpf using windows apis of using windows apis instead of bringing another external dependency for viewing pdfs shoud this be disabled by default to not break existing handlers of e g adobe acrobat not sure maybe it can be enabled by default if no other handlers are installed and disabled if other handers

possible the previewers are enabled in both applicationas automatically this is the same as for the markdown and svg previewerokay i thought we have two different handlers because of your description this solution worries me for arm support when i see the following install package pdfiumviewernativex _ v xfa install package pdfiumviewernativex v xfa rdeveen as crutkas pointed out at this stage we are working towards stability and arm compatibilitywe need to be very conservative and make sure that any dependency we add its tested on arm and doesnt have performance issue on arm the core doesnt have the bandwidth to do such testing for pdfiumviewernativex _ v xfa or package pdfiumviewernativex v xfa so unless you have a way to do such validation on arm we will have to put this pr on hold can we create a quick poc here loading a pdf in a arm app uwp route would be the quickest way to verify i have an surface pro x i can test with the project https githubcom timchen pdfiumviewercore has a demo app maybe you can build iton the other hand the solution martinchrzan is proposing is also working on my machine with windowsdatapdf https docsmicrosoftcom en us uwp api windowsdatapdfviewwinrt i can open the pdf file it can read the pages and then transforms the first page to an image i think this approach is better because its using only microsoft libraries and not the pdfiumviewer what do you think image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a e eb aec f c e c png update also multiple pages is working now only some vertical scrollbar issues image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e

dhowett due to repos policies removed the file rca not sure what happened with the line breaks and how to fix that all files have crlf when i compare the line breaks with the upstream branch i cant find any difference the encoding is also the same can you advice this might be caused by gits autocrlf functionality as wellin the command line what do you get if your run git config coreautocrlf on the repos folder hi rdeveen please checkout https githubcom rdeveen powertoys pull it should normalize line endings on the filesi suspect these mightve been caused by some mismatch in configuration

for a weight multiplier it seems to be a little bit complex for use the default weight multiplier is going to be right anyway it looks like a lot of configurations and one can shoot themself so a good idea would be to have an option to reset the pt run settings to the default one idea would be to show the main action keys in the overview list too then i dont have to open plugin settings to look for it but i have no good idea how to position it maybe under the activation togglewhen in doubt start on a new line are there requests from users for a weight multiplier it seems to be a little bit complex for use the default weight multiplier is going to be right anyway it looks like a lot of configurations and one can shoot themself so a good idea would be to have an option to reset the pt run settings to the defaultyes will be default reset may not be a bad idea but is that a must have most of our stuff lacks a reset crutkas mykhailopylyp in my opinion exposing the weight multiplier to the users is risky and im not even sure its necessaryits risky because we dont have a way to guarantee that the users will understand how it works and what exact impact it haswe might we overwhelmed with questions about itunnecessary because if we do a good job of defining the default value it may be good enough and not require any user intervention crutkas since we have microsoft and community plugins are we going to show that information to the users or will we treat all the plugins as official plugins reset may not be a bad idea but is that a must haveit is definitely not a must have but i think the better option would be boil down the settings so a user can not make pt run unusable as enrico pointed out weight multipliers can bring more confusions than benefits crutkas to make sure we all are on the same pagethere was a bug preventing the weighted results to be stored on diskbecause of that we saw lot of user reports complaining about results not being weightedthis is now fixed for lets see how this impact the user experience and if there is really a need to expose the weight multiplier ill shift weight then as pending feedback but something under consideration addressed feedback in spec crutkaswhat about since we have microsoft and community plugins are we going to show that information to the users or will we treat all the plugins as official plugins crutkas what about since we have microsoft and community plugins are we going to show that information to the users or will we treat all the plugins as official pluginsi think we should mention the community member or that it is a community plugin to appreciate the work sorry missed that will addressed that mykhailopylyp enricogior any other tweaks clarity now we can put a plugin specific settings under a plugin settings for example image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e db d cb eb c f d f png crutkas do we want to provide a list of suggested action keys are there action keys that we know we dont supportother than that it lgtm crutkas do we want to provide a list of suggested action keys are there action keys that we know we dont support should not be supported its the wildcard for global plugins htcfreek that is already specified in the specs enricogior only think that comes to mine would be maybe allowing two plugins to share same would this act like if they share the same action key i think it would only allow a single direct launch imowe could be proactive on conflicts like fz vs pt run but i think that would be a future item as well enricogior if youre ok with that im going to

shortcut comming later additional settings drive warning we can consider it i am a little bit worried that additional settings section would not look good only with one checkbox enricogior what do you think i am not sure if the title activation is a good ideaif we dont want to have the title we should at least sort the settings in groups pt plug_mockup https user imagesgithubusercontentcom fd eb f fef ed ae bpng _ this images are created with a graphics program so the font is incorrect _ htcfreekit is not a good idea to have plugin settings inside of plugin settings maybe additional settings is a better option here on the other hand we introduce additional settings inside of the collapse section and i think that the collapse section should be simple and flat maybe i am mistaken here anyway here how it looks without any headings but kind of with grouping indentations are not ideal image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom c fa eb a bba b a fpng mykhailopylyp htcfreek i like the idea of additional settings since it makes very clear the distinction between the activation settings and the plugins specific settingssome plugin may have several additional settings so its a good idea introduce it mykhailopylypregarding the wording of plugin settings or additional settings i agree with youadditional settings is the better choiceregarding the grouping i would split between action phrase and drive detection warning my intention is that we have general settings global results activation and additional settings like the drive warning mykhailopylyp can you please update the screenshot thank you mykhailopylyp can you rebase the branch htcfreek btw we should add a work item like optimize layout and margins and swap plugin group with appearance group to the parent issue doing this first makes sense if all ux elements are added we already have an issue for it enricogior htcfreek before merging we should consider https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues issuecomment the drive detection field is going to have complex behavior our current approach is not good for that also i do not want to introduce ui in code specification htcfreek btw we should add a work item like optimize layout and margins and swap plugin group with appearance group to the parent issue doing this first makes sense if all ux elements are added we already have an issue for it sory i mean enricogior htcfreek before merging we should consider https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues issuecomment the drive detection field is going to have complex behavior our current approach is not good for that also i do not want to introduce ui in code specification if we rework this setting we could consider adding a link to windows indexing settingsbut imo this is out of this prs scoope and we should do this in a second pr this makes testing easier and i think working on this touches mykhailopylyp is there anything in this pr that you consider a must have for future changes to implement https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues issuecomment if not we can merge it and as htcfreek suggested work on that in another pr that is not high priority right now enricogior is there anything in this pr that you consider a must have for future changes to implement comment https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues issuecomment no i can not think about anything it just seems that the current approach with additional plugin settings would be completely rewritten for and it would become a large cost item with this pr will not be so hard to do if it is not under index plugin settings mykhailopylyp for we can reconsider the approach add a link to the windows settings add a link to the online documentation we dont have to over engineer the pt settings to explain every detail thereand in case we decide we have to over engineer we move it outside of the plugin settings if that is a better solution

for review thanks thiefzero is the pr ready for the final review if it is lets convert it from draft to ready for review thankshi yes id like some feedback on the pr not sure if the feature is implemented ok and if im missing anything if its ok then maybe i can add some tests later dont know how yet thiefzero i think we should have an own plugin symbol icon for each plugin so we cant use the same icon as on calculator plugin maybe niels or someone of the other contributors has an idea 😉 thiefzero what is the remaining work here thiefzero what is the remaining work heremost importantly getting the culture right for use of vs after that it should be good enough to be used bonus are tests if i can figure out how to make them 😄 oh and probably a custom icon no clues there yet though should be good to go now only missing a custom icon thiefzero i think the unit icon is applicable for this converter here are the dark and light images with the right dimensions for that the dark icon is there just not visible because its white on white unitconverter dark https user imagesgithubusercontentcom a b d eb f eaeb d png unitconverter light https user imagesgithubusercontentcom afc f d eb a ee b d d png thiefzero at the moment i am testing the plugin in a local build the first thing i saw is that the result are included in global results i think we should change the default behavior here on german culture settings the dot is ignored and is interpret as this can be confusing do you have an idea how we could improve this case we should add a list to docs which units can be converted can we remove the requirement of a space between number and unit we should should show a warning on unsupported input like this m² in m or m in t suggestion unit conversation or input not supported are units like m² m³ supported htcfreek thiefzero at the moment i am testing the plugin in a local build the first thing i saw is that the result are included in global results i think we should change the default behavior here on german culture settings the dot is ignored and is interpret as this can be confusing do you have an idea how we could improve this casedoesnt germany use comma for decimals if you want the plugin to accept both either the code should probably only use dots as a non separator for thousands so not ignore dots on numbers we should add a list to docs which units can be convertedconsider it done 👍 can we remove the requirement of a space between number and unitill need to adjust the regex for this ill try and see if i can make it work we should should show a warning on unsupported input like this m² in m or m in t i figured not showing any result is a good enough sign the input didnt match anything what kind of message or warning would people expect to see i can add a mismatch result are units like m² m³ supportedm^ wasnt because i didnt enable area conversion ill add it m² to cm² etc thiefzero the support for is nothing we must have it was only a question if we could improve something there so lets not waste time on this for the warning on unsupported input please see my comment above i suggested a text there btw calculator plugin shows a warning on incorrect input i think warning on input that cant be converted is good enough can you please post a list of supported unit types in pr description if possible we should support at least the same as windows calculator any reason why you use an old version of nunit package misspellings found please review angularsen seperates to accept these changes run the following commands

filepopd htcfreeki think i got most of your requested changes done theres a couple i still have questions about the first thing i saw is that the result are included in global results i think we should change the default behavior herei edited the pluginjson and set the isglobal to false i hope thats what you meant if not let me know what exactly needed to be changed i couldnt find it in the docs for the warning on unsupported input please see my comment above i suggested a text there btw calculator plugin shows a warning on incorrect input i think warning on input that cant be converted is good enoughi checked the calculator plugin but couldnt find code that generated the warning i tried to input invalid strings to see if i could generate it such as sqrt but couldnt get the warning to show do you have input and or a reference to the line of code so i can use it as an referencei think these are the only things missing if theres anything else let me know oh i got the requirement of a space between a number and unit removed m to cm works nowi also added in every unit that the windows calculator currently supports even got the kb to kb working correctly which google apparently doesnt do cheers 😄 thiefzero the first thing i saw is that the result are included in global results i think we should change the default behavior here i edited the pluginjson and set the isglobal to

cool 😎 if the last things are done discussed fell free to newly request a review from me 😉 thiefzero please remove anycpu from tests htcfreeki think i got everything needed done the only question is about the warning and whether or not plugins should display them would you prefer to wait for that discussion or start the review and leave it as a possible enhancement in the future as the calculator would probably need it then as well thiefzero i think i got everything needed done the only question is about the warning and whether or not plugins should display them would you prefer to wait for that discussion or start the review and leave it as a possible enhancement in the future as the calculator would probably need it then as well lets start review the warning is not an breaking thing if

seems to be some bugs in master i will open an issue soultion doesnt seem to be fixed on loading sln and starting building the release most of the projects are skipped i have to change props to

seems to be a bug with case sensitive behavior i can only convert from higher to lower unit eg mb to kb but not the other way kb to mb on energy units w in gw the result is rounded to instead of

think so because its not as daily used as program plugin and i worrying about unexpected results on search for other itemsi think we should enable it by default and have globalfalse i tweaked three things directly in your fork to get this to work better one was i literally couldnt get it to run without adding in global i dont think is appropriate flag here as well as that is a global hotkeywhy is a global hotkey or better asking in which case we dont use as global keyword anymore i tweaked three things directly in your fork to get this to work better one was i literally couldnt get it to run without adding in global i dont think is appropriate flag here as well as that is a global hotkey why is a global hotkey or better asking in which case we dont use as global keyword anymore when i think of i think of it as a wild card character aka global what should be trigger maybe a plus sign honestly not sure what would work well maybe crutkas i would suggest to use a two chars activation phrase like crutkas i would suggest to use a two chars activation phrase like thought this isnt supported 🤔 htcfreek we do that with uri foo thiefzero do you have any thoughts for a good cmd line here what feels natural with doubles for something like this i like it when it is the same keystroke or just thiefzero do you have any thoughts for a good cmd line here what feels natural with doubles for something like this i like it when it is the same keystroke or just imo sounds good for me do we use it at the moment htcfreek crutkas is supported should be reserved for system stuff i strongly recommend to not use it for this plugin enricogior crutkas is supporteddont like because i dont think its an intuitive action command should be reserved for system stuff i strongly recommend to not use it for this pluginwhy if i am imagine correctly for settings we use $ for registry we use and for services we use what about as synonym for number or as synonym for round convert htcfreek dont like because i dont think its an intuitive action commandfor activation phrase it doesnt need to be intuitive it needs to not interfere with symbols that have already another meaning in windows and that can prevent to use them in better scenariossince users can change them we need to provide something that is good enough and that wont cause conflicts or prevent future features in other pluginsim actually going to suggest that for non core plugins we should not use single key activation phrase as a general rule thiefzero do you have any thoughts for a good cmd line here what feels natural with doubles for something like this i like it when it is the same keystroke or just thanks for your consideration and actively involving me in the discussion i was approaching it hands off because im not super familiar with the use action keywordsmy thoughts on this im not sure why its necessary to have one in this case as you would need to put something in to convert anyway so having to use an action keyword first only adds another requirement i can see the benefit of having action keywords for something like to list all services but not for plugins that require input for calculator similarly seems redundant to me if im missing something feel free to teach me if we have to choose a keyword for the unitconverter i think theres merit in having the easy to use symbols reserved for microsoft core plugins as opposed to using them for community non core ones so id say that or or would be fine otherwise i like symbolically the best it feels most like values being converted maybe as its non core enricogior im fine with doubles for non core why i suggest the same is doing requires much more movement and a shift between for at least a en us keyboardlets go with for now and see what people

phrase we can turn it off by default and it should work im not sure what the team wants here personally i think having it global by default is better as im guessing its a very basic and useful functionality for most userslastly it still has only the very basic rounding function not the advanced one you suggested this would be the last feature functionality requestedthats all thats left to discuss improve upon but the pr is in its current state good to be merged imo yes we should remove it from default global going to pull it down quickly and test check spelling bot report unrecognized

crutkas any preference of fixing this here or in a second pr thiefzero crutkas i think the unit type in the subtitle should be lower case temperature because it is within a sentence or is this a name

was all done in a single large pr is that this work required rewriting a large partof the backend code which maintains the grid layout so its hard to do incrementally what is include in the pr do not allow new zone layouts to have zones smaller than a predefined amount enough to display the zone index properly in the editor existing zone layouts which do not satisfy this requirement can still be

splitters will now snap smoothly to zone borders using the same magnetic snapping present in the canvas editor smoothsnap https user imagesgithubusercontentcom b d eb ce eb ed b a agif a new data representation simplifies code drastically now the zones always logically occupy the entire screen area and the spacing is added only when the zones are rendered this is what allows for overlapping borders fancyzoneslib code is tweaked to correspond to this new representation there could be a small impact on how existing layouts are drawn perhaps by a couple of pixels how does someone test validate check all functionality of the grid editor splitting zones merging zones resizing adding many zones canceling the edit for more stress testing create a grid layout using the old version create many small zones and set zone spacing to a large value then open the layout in the new editor and try editing it there could be some glitches but there should be no crashescheck whether the

niels what does the x button do what will be the default valuethe x buttons removes the key for that layoutthere is no default value at the moment it may seems logic to add one but it might become confusing if the user deletes and creates layouts since the user would still have to check what number as been assigned and in case change itwe should also consider showing the assigned number in the main viewim ok with the ui changes you proposed they look nice i wonder if win and alt are localized in some languages or are those two icons text based niels what does the x button do what will be

proposed they look nice i wonder if win and alt are localized in some languages or are those two icons text basedah i see so if you press the x or default value is then an empty combobox if so then id remove the button and add a none comboboxitem eg none that screenshot was a mock up but a border with a textblock should work fine in a horizontal stackpanel we can add those to the resources file so it can be localized if it is crutkas do you know niels seraphimaz if so then id remove the button and add a none comboboxitemok lets do thatalso if all the keys are taken can we show none available enricogior that might require some logic changes any stuling i can do in a seperate pr if you want niels ok not super urgent we can do it later what is the default behavior for adding new is there a none option niels seraphimaz if so then id remove the button and add a none comboboxitem ok lets do that also if all the keys are taken can we show none availableis that not confusing if the menu

main concern is that we dont keep update user settings with default options centralized right now we have two methods that are responsible for it combinewithdefaultsettings and updateadditionaloptionssettings somaybe we should move updateadditionaloptionssettings into combinewithdefaultsettings mykhailopylyp i understandi have trying to combine the methods and i figured out that this logic is causing this issue https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues the point is that additional settings should be updated once on pt run startup and not in the readsettings that is used by the file system watcher does it make sense to move updateadditionaloptionssettings and combinewithdefaultsettings outside readsettings i have trying to combine the methods and i figured out that this logic is causing this issue can you elaborate here the point is that additional settings should be updated once on pt run startup and not in the readsettings that is used by the file system watcheractually combinewithdefaultsettings should be called only on pt run startup as well does it make sense to move updateadditionaloptionssettings and combinewithdefaultsettings outside readsettings dont see any reasons why we should move it out add new plugins add missing additional options and update additional options labels should be done only once at startupdoing this inside the file system watcher is causing this issue https githubcom microsoft powertoys issues since every time the file is changed by the settings the launcher is going to update the additional options and save the file again add new plugins add missing additional options and update additional options labels should be done only once at startupdoing this inside the file system watcher is causing this issue in this pr updateadditionaloptionssettings is called from readsettings so it is called on file change as welllets move combinewithdefaultsettings options and and updateadditionaloptionssettings into separate method that is called only on startup mykhailopylyp i have updated the pr let me know what do you think about this solutiontested add new plugins add new additional options update

created an issue sounds good on fixing those together thank you sounds good on fixing those together thank youafter looking into it more detailed i think we should fix that in an other pr fixing the deletion bug requires a rework of the helper classi will upload more details and a concept drawing in the issue within the next days because of that i think it makes more sense to merge this pr as is for fixing the crash bug now i agree it should be fixed on another pr please mark this pr as ready to review when you think its ready to go 😉 thank you check spelling bot report unrecognized words

for your information i am adding that to tests and adjusting the codei do think we should handle the application uri and the http uri as the same result type to reduce the complexity of this so htcfreek the mailto wont be a valid format so htcfreek the mailto wont be a valid formatthe app opens the point is that settings app expects the name of the sub pages directly after the and without a

image https user imagesgithubusercontentcom e f c bee bce fceb png but we currently have the uri handler to opens urls and unc network shares adding another plugin just adds the complexity of this and

and which one to be handled by the new application uri handler since it is hard to tell http https mailto ftp ms settings microsoft edge apart to which is the url and application uri the uri is executed by shell execute and the the shell decides based on the protocol uri assignments the point is that http and https are assigned to your default browser based on the fact is that ftp isnt opened by default with your default browser only if you assigned it to this browser in the extendeturiparser we hafe a selection if it is http https or an other uri type if you add a new return value or property that decides if it is default browser or app handler then you can choose different result properties maybe we need a custom class for that https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob f afb b

htcfreek ive found difficulties to tell https is valid and ms settings is invalid the only way i thought is hard coded http and https as a valid format but the rest of it not this doesnt seem to be a good solution i agree we should not introduce a new plugin either we handle it by uri plugin or we add it to program plugin which makes more sense to me these uris are used to open appsill keep it into the uri handler based on the reason written in the first part of this comment in the extendeturiparser we hafe a selection if it is http https or an other uri type if you add a new return value or property that decides if it is default browser or app handler then you can choose different result properties maybe we need a custom class for that we currently do have the return value true and false to indicate if the uri format is valid we cloud change the return type to string or add another out parameter to indicate an uri to be handled by the browser http https an uri to be handled by the application mailto ftp ms settings an invalid uri or do you have a better suggestion note the commit below this is a wip just for me to switch between my computers ill amend it later please ignore it and its pipeline error can you explain the problem a bit more i dont unterstand your problem what do you need expect instead htcfreek ive found difficulties to tell https is valid and ms settings is invalid the only way i thought is hard coded http and https as a valid format but the rest of it not this doesnt seem to be a good solution lets ignore that as do as if ms settings is valid the opens only on the main page instead of the sub page i dont we should add complexity because of this i agree we should not introduce a new plugin either we handle it by uri plugin or we add it to program plugin which makes more sense to me these uris are used to open apps ill keep it into the uri handler based on the reason written in the first part of this comment 👍🏻 in the extendeturiparser

note the commit below this is a wip just for me to switch between my computers ill amend it later please ignore it and its pipeline error👍🏻 lets ignore that as do as if ms settings is valid the opens only on the main page instead of the sub page i dont we should add complexity because of thissounds great ill do it this way we currently do have the return value true and false to indicate if the uri format is valid we cloud change the return type to string or add another out parameter to indicate an uri to be handled by the browser http https an uri to be handled by the application mailto ftp ms settings an invalid uriill open this part as another pr since this needs more works all uri will be sent to the browser for now and ill open another pr to send the application uri to the apps handler according to rfc https datatrackerietforg doc html rfc an uri has two slashes at the beginning of the hier part when the uri scheme accepts authority pathsmaybe we should also add test for uris with authority paths like ftp user password localhost according to rfc https datatrackerietforg doc html rfc an uri has two slashes at the beginning of the hier part when the uri scheme accepts authority paths maybe we should also add test for uris with authority paths like ftp user password localhost test will be added ftp user password localhost aaron junker this will be parsed as ftp user password localhost with the ending slash this is working very nicely its strange for it to still use the browser image though can we use another image instead for theseyes but it needs bigger work we discussed this in the comments before might be part of a second prhttps githubcom microsoft powertoys pull issuecomment https githubcom microsoft powertoys pull issuecomment so the main issue with merging it on main right now is that itll keep the same item and say the action is to open it in browser which is not true anymorei think the places to fix this would be either here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob d df efebae f fc cbb e b src modules launcher plugins microsoftpluginuri maincsl l or here https githubcom microsoft powertoys blob d df efebae f fc cbb e b src modules launcher plugins microsoftpluginuri maincsl l if this is a multi pr feature it should be merged into another branch first and only merged to main after all the prs go indoes this make sensedo you want me to create this branch jaimecbernardo lets ask franky he is the pr owner jaimecbernardo agree please create a branch for this and merge this pr into it this became a larger work item than i expected and not possible for me to complete it in a single pr thank youpointing it to feature ptrun_application_uri
